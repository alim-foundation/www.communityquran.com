= Row Version Migrations

Row Version Migrations is a plugin that automatically generates the following
row version columns for every table:

  :created_at,   :datetime,  :null => false
  :updated_at,   :datetime,  :null => false
  :lock_version, :integer,   :null => false, :default => 0

If you have a table for which you do not want row version columns to be
generated, simply pass <code>:row_version => false</code> as an option to +create_table+:

  create_table :orders, :row_version => false do |t|
    ...
  end
