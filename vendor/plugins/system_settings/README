= System Settings

System Settings is a plugin that provides a convenient way to store and
retrieve system configuration settings in the database. The plugin provides a
single model +SystemSetting+ with two properties: +name+; and +value+. Names
must be unique whereas values have no such restriction.

To create and retrieve system settings, the usual active record operations can
be used:

  SystemSetting.create(:name => :environment, :value => 'production')
  SystemSetting.find_by_name(:environment)    # 'production'
  SystemSetting[:environment]                 # 'production'

System Settings requires the creation of a single table. You may choose to
perform this step manually, or use the generator provided. To use the
generator, run:

  ./script/generate system_settings_migration

This will generate an appropriately numbered migration script named
<code>NNN_create_system_settings.rb</code> in the <code>db/migrate</code>
directory. The next time you run rake migrate, the table will automatically be
created for you.

If you would prefer a different name for the script, simply pass the name as
an argument. For example:

  ./script/generate system_settings_migration create_the_system_settings_table
  
The plugin fully supports and understands the following active-record
configuration properties:

* <code>config.active_record.pluralize_table_names</code>
* <code>config.active_record.table_name_prefix</code>
* <code>config.active_record.table_name_suffix</code>

=== Dependencies

* Schema Validations (schema_validations)--unless you choose to implement the functionality yourself.
