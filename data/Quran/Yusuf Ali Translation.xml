			In the name of Allah Most Gracious Most Merciful. <fn>19</fn>
			<note id="19">
				The Arabic words "Rahman" and "Rahim" translated "Most
				Gracious" and "Most Merciful" are both intensive forms
				referring to different aspects of God's attribute of
				Mercy.	The Arabic intensive is more suited to express
				God's attributes than the superlative degree in English. 
				The latter implies a comparison with other beings, or
				with other times or places, while there is no being like
				unto God, and He is independent of Time and Place.  Mercy
				may imply pity, long-suffering, patience, and
				forgiveness, all of which the sinner needs and God Most
				Merciful bestows in abundant measure.  But there is a
				Mercy that goes before even the need arises, the Grace
				which is ever watchful, and flows from God Most Gracious
				to all His creatures, protecting the, preserving them,
				guiding them, and leading them to clearer light and
				higher life.  For this reason the attribute Rahman (Most
				Gracious) is not applied to any but God, but the
				attribute Rahim (Merciful), is a general term, and may
				also be applied to Men.  To make us contemplate these
				boundless gifts of God, the formula:  "In the name of God
				Most Gracious, Most Merciful": is placed before every
				Sura of the Qur-an (except the ninth), and repeated at
				the beginning of every act by the Muslim who dedicates
				his life to God, and whose hope is in His Mercy.

				maturity.  God cares for all the worlds He has created.

			Master of the Day of Judgment.

		<ayah num="5">
			Thee do we worship and Thine aid we seek. <fn>21</fn>
			<note id="21">
				On realizing in our souls God's love and care, His grace
				and mercy, and His power and justice (as Ruler of the Day
				of Judgment), the immediate result is that we bend in the
				act of worship, and see both our shortcomings and His
				all-sufficient power.  The emphatic form means that not
				only do we reach the position of worshipping God and
				asking for His help, but we worship Him alone and ask for
				His aid only.  For there is none other than He worthy of
				our devotion and able to help us.  The plural "we"
				indicates that we associate ourselves with all who seek
				God, thus strengthening ourselves and strengthening them
				in a fellowship of faith.

		<ayah num="6">
			Show us the straight way. <fn>22</fn>
			<note id="22">
				If we translate by the English word "guide," we shall
				have to say:  "Guide us to and in the straight Way."  For
				we many be wandering aimlessly, and the first step is to
				find the Way; and the second need is to keep in the Way: 
				our own wisdom may fail in either case.  The straight Way
				is often the narrow Way, or the steep Way, which many
				people shun (xc.11).  By the world's perversity the
				straight Way is sometimes stigmatized and the crooked Way
				praised.  How are we to judge?	We must ask for God's
				guidance.  With a little spiritual insight we shall see
				which are the people who walk in the light of God's
				grace, and which are those that walk in the darkness of
				Wrath.	This also would help our judgment.
			</note>

		<ayah num="7">
			The way of those on whom Thou hast bestowed Thy Grace Those whose
			(portion) is not wrath and who go not astray. <fn>23</fn>
			<fn>24</fn>
			<note id="23">
				Note that the words relating to Grace are connected
				actively with God; those relating to Wrath are
				impersonal.  In the one case God's Mercy encompasses us
				beyond our deserts.  In the other case our own actions
				are responsible for the Wrath, the negative of Grace,
				Peace, or Harmony.
			</note>
			<note id="24">
				Are there two categories? - those who are in the darkness
				of Wrath and those who stray?  The first are those who
				deliberately break God's law; the second those who stray
				out of carelessness or negligence.  Both are responsible
				for their own acts or omissions.  In opposition to both
				are the people who are in the light of God's Grace:  for
				His Grace not only protects them from active wrong (if
				they will only submit their will to Him) but also from
				straying into paths of temptation or carelessness.  The
				negative gair should be construed as applying not to the
				way, but as describing men protected from two dangers by
				God's Grace.

			<note id="30">
				Kafara kufr, kafr, and derivative forms of the word,
				imply a deliberate rejection of Faith as opposed to a
				mistaken idea of God or faith, which is not inconsistent
				with an earnest desire to see the truth.  Where there is
				such desire, the grace and mercy of God gives guidance. 
				But that guidance is not efficacious when it is
				deliberately rejected and the possibility of rejection
				follows from the grant of free will.  The consequence of
				the rejection is that the spiritual faculties become dead
				or impervious to better influences.  See also n. 93 to
				ii.88.

				and fruit trees of which the choicest fruit is before
				you.  The fruit of goodness is goodness, similar, but
				choicer in every degree of ascent.  You think it is the
				same, but it is because of your past experiences and
				associations of memory.  Then there is companionship.  If
				sex is suggested, its physical associations are at once
				negatived by the addition of the word Mutahharatun "pure
				and holy."  The Arabic epithet is in the intensive form,
				and must be translated by two adjectives denoting purity
				in the highest degree.	The Companionship is that of
				souls and applies to both sexes in the physical world of
				men and women.	And this felicity is not a mere passing
				phase but will abide beyond the realms of Time.

			Allah disdains not to use the similitude of things lowest as well
			as highest.  Those who believe know that it is truth from their
			Lord; but those who reject Faith say: "What means Allah by this
			similitude?" By it He causes many to stray and many He leads into
			the right path but He causes not to stray except those who
			forsake (the path). <fn>45</fn>
			<note id="45">
				The word for "the lowest" in the original Arabic means a
				gnat, a byword in the Arabic language for the weakest of
				creatures.  In xxix 41, which was revealed before this
				Sura, the similtutde of the Spider was used, and
				similarly in xxii 73, there is the similitude of the Fly.
				 For similitudes taken from magnificent forces of nature,
				expressed in exalted language, see ii. 19 above.  To God
				all His creation has some special meaning appropriate to
				itself, and some of what we consider the lowest creatures
				have wonderful aptitudes, e.g., the spider of the fly. 
				Parables like these may be an occasion of stumbling to
				those "who forsake the path"; in other words those who
				deliberately shut their eyes to God's Signs, and their
				Penalty is attributed to God, the Cause of all causes. 
				But lest there should be misunderstanding, it is
				immediately added that the stumbling and offence only
				occur as the result of the sinner's own choice of the
				wrong course. Verses 26 and 27 form one sentence and
				should be read together.  "Forsaking the path" is defined
				in ii. 27, viz., breaking solemn covenants which the
				sinner's own soul had ratified, causing division among
				mankind, who were meant to be one brotherhood, and doing
				as much mischief as possible in the life on this earth,
				for the life beyond will be on another plane, where no
				rope will be given to evil.

				In the preceeding verses God has used various arguments.

				misunderstandings arise from a deliberate rejection of
				the light and breach of the Covenant (ii. 26-27).  Now
				(ii. 28-29) He pleads with His creatures and appeals to
				their own subjective feelings.	He brought you into
				being.	The mysteries of life and death are in His hands.
				 When you die on this earth, that is not the end.  You
				were of Him, and you must return to Him.  Look around you

			Behold thy Lord said to the angels: "I will create a vicegerent

			praises and glorify Thy holy (name)?"  He said: "I know what ye

			<note id="47">
				It would seem that the angels, though holy and pure, and
				endued with power from God, yet represented only one side
				of Creation.  We may imagine them without passion or
				emotion, of which the highest flower is love.  If man was
				to be endued with emotions, those emotions would lead him
				to the highest and drag him to the lowest.  The power of
				will or choosing would have to go with them, in order
				that man might steer his own bark.  This power of will
				(when used aright) gave him to some extent a mastery over
				his own fortunes and over nature, thus bringing him
				nearer to the God-like nature which has supreme mastery
				and will. We may suppose the angels had no independent
				wills of their own; their perfection in other ways
				reflected God's perfection but could not raise them to
				the dignity of vicegerency.  The perfect vicegerent is he
				who has the power of initiative himself, but whose
				independent action always reflects perfectly the will of
				his Principal.	The distinction is expressed by
				Shakespeare (Sonnet 94) in those fine lines: "They are
				the lords and owners of their faces.  Others but stewards
				of their excellence."  The angels in their one-sidedness
				saw only the mischief consequent on the misuse of the
				emotional nature by man; perhaps they also, being without
				emotions, did not understand the whole of God's nature,
				which gives and asks for love.	In humility and true
				devotion to God, they remonstrate; we must not imagine
				the least tinge of jealousy, as they are without emotion.
				 This mystery of love being above them, they are told
				that they do not know and they acknowledge (in ii. 32
				below) not their fault (for there is no question of
				fault) but their imperfection of knowledge.  At the same
				time, the matter is brought home to them when the actual
				capacities of man are shown to them (ii. 31, 33).

				The literal words in Arabic throughout this passage are:
				"The names of things" which commentators take to mean the
				inner nature and qualities of things, and things here
				would include feelings.  The whole passage is charged
				with mystic meaning.  The particular qualities or
				feelings which were outside the nature of angels were put
				by God into the nature of man.	Man was thus able to love
				and understand love, and thus plan and initiate, as
				becomes the office of vicegerent.  The angels
				acknowledged this.  These things they could only know
				from the outside, but they had faith, or belief in the
				Unseen.  And they knew that God saw all - what others
				see, what others do not see, what others may even wish to
				conceal.  Man has many qualities which are latent or
				which he may wish to suppress or conceal, to his own
				detriment.

				The bondage of Egypt was indeed a tremendous trial.  Even
				the Egyptians' wish to spare the lives of Israel's
				females when the males were slaughtered, added to the
				bitterness of Israel.  Their hatred was cruel, but their
				"love" was still more cruel.  About the hard tasks, see
				Exod. i. 14: "They made their lives bitter with hard
				bondage, in mortar and in brick, and in all manner of
				service in the field; all their service, wherein they
				made them serve, was with rigour." Pharaoh's taskmasters
				gave no straw, yet ordered the Israelites to make bricks
				without straw: Exod. v 5-19.  Pharoah's decree was:
				"Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and
				every daughter ye shall save alive":  Exod. i. 22.  It
				was in consequence of this decree that Moses was hidden
				three months after he was born, and when he could be
				hidden no longer, he was put into an ark of bulrushes and
				cast into the Nile, where he was found by Pharoah's
				daughter and wife (xxviii. 9), and adopted into the
				family: Exod. ii. 2-10. Cf. xx. 37-40.	Thus Moses was
				brought up by the enemies of his people.  He was chosen

				every man his neighbor... and there fell of the people

				be that the order for slaying was given by way of trial,
				but was withdrawn, for God turned to them in forgiveness.
				 A still more spiritualized way of construing it would be
				to take "anfusakum" as meaning "souls" not "selves".

				Here we have a reference to the tribal organization of
				the Jews, which played a great part in their forty years'
				march through the Arabian deserts (Num. i. and ii.) and
				their subsequent settlement in the land of Canaan (Josh.
				xxii. and xiv.).  The twelve tribes were derived from the
				sons of Jacob, whose name was changed to Israel (soldier
				of God) after he had wrestled, says Jewish tradition,
				with God (Genesis xxxii. 28).  Israel had twelve sons
				(Gen. xxxv. 22-26), including Levi and Joseph.	The
				descendants of these twelve sons were the "Children of
				Israel."  Levi's family got the priesthood and the care
				of the Tabernacle; they were exempted from military
				duties for which the census was taken (Nu. i. 47-53), and
				therefore from the distribution of Land in Canaan (Josh.
				xiv. 3); they were distributed among all the Tribes, and
				were really a privileged caste and not numbered among the
				Tribes; Moses and Aaron belonged to the house of Levi. 
				On the other hand Joseph, on account of the high position
				to which he rose in Egypt as the Pharoah's minister, was
				the progenitor of two tribes, one in the name of each of
				his two sons Ephraim and Manasseh.  Thus there were
				twelve Tribes in all, as Levi was cut out and Joseph
				represented two tribes.  Their having fixed stations and
				watering places in camp and fixed territorial areas later
				in the Promised Land prevented confusion and mutual
				jealousies and is pointed to as an evidence of the
				Providence of God acting through His prophet Moses.  Cf.

				The declension of the word Misr in the Arabic text here
				shows that it is treated as a common noun meaning any

				be to the Egypt of Pharoah.  The Tanwin expressing
				indefiniteness may mean "any Egypt", i.e., any country as
				fertile as Egypt.  There is here a subtle reminiscence as
				well as a severe reproach.  The rebellious children of
				Israel murmured at the sameness of the food they got in
				the desert.  They were evidently hankering after the
				delicacies of the Egypt which they had left, although
				they should have known that the only thing certain for
				them in Egypt was their bondage and harsh treatment. 
				Moses's reproach to them was twofold: (1) Such variety of

				sell your freedom?  Is not freedom better than delicate
				food?  (2) In front is the rich Promised Land, which you

			<note id="80">
				This story or parable of the heifer in ii. 67-71 should
				be read with the parable of the dead man brought to life
				in ii. 72-73.  The stories were accepted in Jewish
				traditions, which are themselves based on certain
				sacrificial directions in the Old Testament.  The heifer
				story of Jewish tradition is based on Num. xix. 1-10, in
				which Moses and Aaron ordered the Israelites to sacrifice
				a red heifer without spot or blemish; her body was to be
				burnt and the ashes were to be kept for the purification
				of the congregation from sin.  The parable of the dead
				man we shall refer to later. The lesson of the heifer
				parable is plain. Moses announced the sacrifice the the
				Israelites, and they treated it as a jest. When Moses
				continued solemnly to ask fo the sacrifice, they put him
				off on one pretext and another, asking a number of
				questions which they could have answered themeselves if
				they had listened to Moses's directions. Their questions
				were carping criticisms rather than the result of a
				desire for information. It was a mere thin pretence that
				they were genuinely seeking for guidance. When at last
				they were driven into a corner, they made the sacrifice,
				but the will was wanting, which would have made the
				sacrifice efficacious for purification from sin. The real
				reason for their prevarications was their guilty
				conscience, as we see in the parable of the dead man (ii.
				72-73).

				In Deut. xxi. 1-9 it is ordained that if the body of a
				slain man be found in a field and the slayer is not
				known, a heifer shall be beheaded, and the elders of the
				city next to the slain man's domicile shall wash their
				hands over the heifer and say that they neither did the
				deed nor saw it done, thus clearing themselves from the
				blood-guilt. The Jewish story based on this was that in a
				certain case of this kind, every one tried to clear
				himself of guilt and lay the blame at the door of others.
				In the first place they tried to prevaricate and prevent
				a heifer being slain as in the last parable. When she was
				slain, Allah by a miracle disclosed the really guilty
				person. A portion of the sacrificed heifer was ordered to
				be placed on the corpse, which came to life and disclosed
				the whole story of the crime.  The lesson of this parable
				is that men may try to hide their crimes individually or
				collectively, but Allah will bring them to light in
				unexpected ways. Applying this further to Jewish national
				history, the argument is developed in the following
				verses that the Children of Israel played fast and loose
				with their own rites and traditions, but they ould not
				thus evade the consequences of their own sin.

			Thenceforth were your hearts hardened; they became like a rock

			Allah.	And Allah is not unmindful of what ye do. <fn>82</fn>
			<note id="82">
				The sinner's heart gets harder and harder.  It is even
				harder than rocks, of which a beautiful poetical allegory
				is placed before us.  In nature we think there is nothing
				harder than rocks.  But there are rocks that weep
				voluntarily, like repentant hearts that come to God of
				their own accord; such are the rocks from which rivers
				and springs flow spontaneously, sometimes in small
				trickles, sometimes in big volumes.  Then there are rocks
				which have to be split or dug into or blown up with
				dynamite, and underneath we find abundant waters, as in
				wells beneath rocky soil.  Such are the hearts of a less
				degree of fineness, which yet melt into tears when some
				great blow or calamity calls the mind to higher things. 
				And lastly, there are the rocks which slip or sink by
				geological pressure or in an earthquake, and send forth
				large spouts of water, as happened, for example, in the
				Bihar earthquake of 1934; such sinking or quaking may be
				poetically ascribed to fear.  So there are hearts which
				will come to God by no higher motive than fear, but yet
				fear will melt them into tears of repentance. But the
				hardened sinner is worse than all these.  His case is
				worse than that of rocks, for nothing will melt him.

				The immediate argument applies to the Jews of Medina, but
				the more general argument applies to the people of Faith
				and the people without Faith, as we shall see below.  If
				the Muslims of Medina ever entertained the hope that the
				Jews in their city would as a body welcome Muhammad
				Mustafa as the Prophet prophesied in their own books,
				they were mistaken.  In Deut. xviii. 18, they read: "I
				will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren,
				like unto thee." (i.e., like unto Moses) which was
				interpreted by some of their doctors as referring to
				Muhammad, and they came into Islam.  The Arabs are a
				kindred branch of the Semitic family, and are correctly
				described in relation to the Jews as "their brethren";
				and there is no question that there was not another
				Prophet "like unto Moses" until Muhammad came; in fact
				the postcript of Deuteronomy, which was written many
				centuries after Moses, says: "There arose not a prophet
				since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face
				to face." But the Jews as a body were jealous of
				Muhammad, and played a double part.  When the Muslim
				community began to grow stronger they pretended to be of
				them, but really tried to keep back any knowledge of
				their own Scriptures from them, lest they should be
				beaten by their own arguments. The more general
				interpretation holds good in all ages. Faith and Unfaith
				are pitted against each other. Faith has to struggle
				against power, position, organization, and privilege.
				When it gains ground, Unfaith comes forward insincerely
				and claims fellowship. But in its own mind it is jealous
				of the armoury of sience and knowledge which Faith brings
				into the service of Allah.  But Allah knows all, and if
				the people of Faith will only seek knowledge sincerely
				wherefver they can find it,-even as far afield as China,
				as Muhammad said, they can defeat Unfaith on its own
				ground. [Even though the directive that Muslims should
				derive knowledge regardless of its location is an
				acceptable proposition from the Islamic viewpoint, the
				tradition to which the author refers here is not
				authentic].

				The argument of i. 76 is continued.  The Jews wanted to
				keep back knowledge, but what knowledge had they?  Many
				of them, even if they could read, were no better than
				illiterates, for they knew not their own true Scriptures,
				but read into them what they wanted, or at best their own
				conjectures.  They palmed off their own writings for the
				Message of God.  Perhaps it brought them profit for the
				time being; but it was a miserable profit if they "gained
				the whole world and lost their own souls" (Matt. xvi.
				26).  "Writing with their own hands" means inventing
				books themselves, which had no divine authority. The
				general argument is similar. Unfaith erects its own false
				gods. It attributes things to causes which only exist in
				its own imagination. Sometimes it even indulges in actual
				dishonest traffic in the ignorance of the multitude. It
				may pay for a time, but the bubble always bursts.

				special prerogative, such as race, "civilation,"
				political power, historical experience, and so on, these
				will not avail in Allah's sight. His promise is sure, but

				time of Jesus; they have often given the lie to God's

				Secondly, extending the review of that history to the

				After the Commandments and the Law had been given at
				Mount Sinai, and the people had solemnly given their
				Covenant,  Moses went up to the Mount, and in his
				absence, the people made the golden calf.  When Moses
				returned, his anger waxed hot.	"He took the Calf which
				they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to
				powder, and strewed it upon the water, and made the
				children of Israel drink of it."  (Exod. xxxii. 20). 
				This incident is interpreted in the Qur-an allegorically.
				 The Calf is the symbol of disobedience, rebellion, want
				of faith.  It was like a taint of poison.  Their
				punishment was to swallow the taint of poison which they
				had themselves produced.  They swallowed it not into
				their stomachs, but into their hearts, their very being. 
				They had to mortify and humble themselves in the sight of
				God, as was shown in another allegory based on the Jewish
				narrative (see ii. 54 and note, above).

				have found proofs in them to show that the new Message
				was true and from God.	But they ignored their own Books

				was false and evil.  Many wonderful tales of occult power

				The word which I have translated by the word

				sense for God's revelations, as in ii. 39 and for other
				Signs of God in history or nature, or miracles, as in ii.
				61.  It has even been used for human signs and tokens of
				wonder, as, for example, monuments or landmarks built by
				the ancient people of Ad (xxvi. 128).  What is the
				meaning here?  If we take it in a general sense, it means
				that God's Message from age to age is always the same,
				but that its form may differ according to the needs and
				exigencies of the time.  That form was different as given
				to Moses and then to Jesus and then to Muhammad. Some

				about the Qur-an, that some of its verses are basic or
				fundamental, and others are allegorical, and it is
				mischievous to treat the allegorical verses and follow
				them (literally).  On the other hand, it is absurd to
				treat such a verse as ii. 115 as if it were abrograted by

			To Him is due the primal origin of the heavens and the earth;

			<note id="120">
				The previous verse told us that everything in heaven and
				earth celebrates the glory of God.  Lest anyone should
				think that the heavens and the earth were themselves
				primeval and eternal, we are now told that they
				themselves are creatures of God's will and design.  Cf
				vi. 102, where the word bada'a is used as here for the
				creation of the heavens and the earth, and khalaqa is
				used for the creation of all things.  Bada'a goes back to
				the very primal beginning, as far as we can conceive it. 
				The materialists might say that primeval matter was
				eternal; other things, i.e., the forms and shapes as we
				see them now, were called into being at some time or
				other, and will perish.  When they perish, they dissolve
				into primeval matter again, which stands as the base of
				all existence. We go further back.  We say that if we
				postulate such primeval matter, it owes its origin itself
				to God	Who is the final basis of existence, the Cause of
				all Causes.  If this is conceded, we proceed to argue
				that the process of Creation is not then completed.  "All
				things in the heavens and on the earth" are created by
				gradual processes.  In "things" we include abstract as
				well as material things.  We see the abstract things and
				ideas actually growing before us.  But that also is God's
				creation, to which we can apply the word khalaqa, for in
				it is involved the idea of measuring, fitting it into a
				scheme of other things. Cf. liv. 49; also xxv. 59.  Here
				comes in what we know as the process of evolution.  On
				the other hand, the "amr" (=Command, Direction, Design)
				is a single thing, unrelated to Time, "like the twinkling
				of an eye" (liv. 50). Another word to note in this
				connection is ja'ala "making" which seems to imply new
				shapes and forms, new dispositions, as the making of the
				Signs of the Zodiac in the heavens, or the setting out of
				the sun and moon for light, or the establishment of the
				succession of day and night (xxv 61-62).  A further
				process with regard to the soul is described in the word
				sawwa, bringing it to perfection (xci. 7) but this we
				shall discuss in its place.  Fatara (xlii. 11) implies,
				like bada'a, the creating of a thing out of nothing and
				after no preexisting similitude, but perhaps fatara
				implies the creation of primeval matter to which further
				processes have to be applied later, as when one prepares
				dough but leaves the leavining to be done after.  Badaa
				(without the 'ain), xxx. 27, implies beginning the
				process of creation; this is made further clear in xxxii.
				7 where the beginning of the creation of pristine man
				from clay refers to his physical body, leaving the
				further processes of reproduction and the breathing in of
				the soul to be described in subsequent verses.	Lastly,
				baraa is creation implying liberation from pre-existing
				matter or circumstance, e.g, man's body from clay (lix.
				24) or a calamity from previously existing circumstances
				(lvii. 22).  See also vi. 94, n. 916; vi. 98, n. 923;
				lix. 24, nn. 5405-6.

				The Ka'ba, the House of God.  Its foundation goes back by
				Arab tradition to Abraham.  Its fourfold character is
				here referred to. (1) It was the centre to which all the
				Arab tribes resorted for trade, for poetic contests, and
				for worship, (2) It was sacred territory and was
				respected by friend and foe alike. At certain seasons,
				all fighting was and is forbidden within it limits, and
				even arms are not allowed to be carried and no game or
				other thing is allowed to be killed.  Like the Cities of
				Refuge under the Mosaic Dispensation to which manslayers
				could flee (Num. xxxv. 6) or the Sanctuaries in Mediaeval
				Europe, to which criminals could not be pursued.  Mecca
				was recognized by Arab custom as inviolable for the
				pursuit of revenge or violence.  (3) It was a place of
				prayer; even today there is a Station of Abraham within
				the enclosure where Abraham was supposed to have prayed. 
				(4) It must be held pure and sacred for all purposes.
			</note>
			<note id="126">
				Four rites are here enumerated, which have now acquired a
				technical meaning. (1) Compassing the sacred territory,
				or going round the Ka'ba: Tawaf.  There are special
				guides who take pilgrims and visitors round.  (2)
				Retiring to the place as a spiritual retreat, for
				contemplation and prayer: Itikat.  (3) The posture of
				bending the back in prayer: Ruku. (4) The posture of
				prostrating oneself on the ground in prayer: Sujud.  The
				protection of the holy territory is for all, but special
				cleanliness and purity is required for the sake of the
				devotees who undertake these rites.

				The root salama in the word Islam implies (among other
				ideas) the idea of Peace, and therefore when Mecca is the
				city of Islam, it is also the City of Peace. The same
				root occurs in the latter part of the name Jerusalem, the
				Jewish City of Peace.  When the day of Jerusalem passed
				(see verse 134 or 141 below),  Mecca became the "New
				Jerusalem" - or rather the old and original "City of
				Peace" restored and made universal.

				The territory of Mecca is barren and rocky, compared
				with, say Taif, a city 70-75 miles east of Mecca.  A
				prayer for the prosperity of Mecca therefore includes a
				prayer for the good things of material life.  This is the
				literal meaning.  But note that the opposition in this
				verse is between the fruits of the Garden for the
				righteous and the torments of the Fire for the evil ones
				- a spiritual allegory of great force and aptness.

				How beautiful this prayer is, and how aptly it comes in
				here in the argument! Such Paganism or star-worship or
				planet-worship as there was in Abraham's time was first
				cleared out of Mecca by Abraham.  This is the chief
				meaning of "sanctification" or purification in ii. 125,
				although of course physical cleanliness is (in physical
				conditions) a necessary element of purification in the
				higher sense.  Abraham and his elder son Ismail then
				built the Ka'ba and established the rites and usages of
				the sacred city.  He was thus the founder of the original
				Islam (which is as old as mankind) in Arabia.  As becomes
				a devout man, he offers and dedicates the work to God in
				humble supplication, addressing Him as the All-Hearing
				and the All-Knowing.  He then asks for a blessing on
				himself and his progeny generally, both the children of
				his eldest-born Ismail and his younger son Isaac.  With
				prophetic vision he foresees that there will be
				corruption and backsliding in both branches of his
				family: Mecca will house 360 idols, and Jerusalem will
				become a harlot city (Ezekiel xvi. 15), a city of
				abomination.  But the light of Islam will shine, and
				reclaim the lost people in both branches and indeed in
				all the world.	So he prays for God's mercy, addressing
				Him as the Oft-Returning Most Merciful.  And finally he
				foresees in Mecca an Apostle teaching the people as one
				"of their own", and in their own beautiful Arabic
				language; he asks for a blessing on Muhammad's ministry,
				appealing to the Power and Wisdom of God.

				with first-hand knowledge, and ready to intervene in the

				position of witness to whom disputants can appeal is held

				This shows the sincere desire of Mustafa to seek light
				from above in the matter of the Qibla.	Until the
				organisation of his own People into a well-knit
				community, with its distinctive laws and ordinances, he
				followed a practice based on the fact that the Jews and
				Christians looked upon Jerusalem as a sacred city.  But
				there was no universal Qibla among them.  Some Jews
				turned towards Jerusalem, especially during the
				Captivity, as we shall see later.  At the time of our
				Prophet, Jerusalem was in the hands of the Byzantine
				Empire, which was Christian.  But the Christians oriented
				their churches to the East (hence the word "orientation")
				which is a point of the compass, and not the direction of
				any sacred place.  The fact of the altar being in the
				East does not mean that every worshipper has his face to
				the east; for, according at least to modern practice, the
				seats in a church are so placed that different
				worshippers may face in different directions.  The
				Preacher of Unity naturally wanted, in this as in other
				matters, a symbol of complete unity, and his heart was
				naturally delighted when the Qibla towards the Ka'ba was
				settled.  Its connection with Abraham gave it great
				antiquity; its character of being an Arab centre made it
				appropriate when the Message came in Arabic, and was
				preached through the union of the Arabs; at the time it
				was adopted, the little Muslim community was shut out of
				it, being exiles in Medina, but it became a symbol of
				hope and eventual triumph, of which Muhammad lived to see
				the fulfilment; and it also became the centre and
				gathering ground of all peoples in the universal
				pilgrimage, which was instituted with it.

				The sacred Mosque: The Ka'ba in the sacred city of Mecca.
				 It is not correct to suggest that the command making the

				that East and West belong to God, and He is everywhere. 
				This is perfectly true at all times, before and after the
				institution of the Qibla.  As if to emphasise this, the
				same words about East and West are repeated in this very
				passage; see ii, 142 above.  Where the Itqan mentions
				mansukh in this connection, I am sorry I cannot follow
				that opinion, unless mansukh is defined in a special way,

				by frequently mentioning; to rehearse; to celebrate or
				commemorate; to make much of; to cherish the memory of as
				a precious possession.	In Sufi devotions zikr represents
				both a solemn ritual and a spiritual state of mind or
				heart, in which the devotee seeks to realise the presence
				of God.  Thus there is zikr of the mind and zikr of the
				heart.	For beginners the one may lead to the other, but
				in many cases the two may be simultaneous.  There is a
				subtler distinction, between the zikr that is open, and
				the zikr that is secret, corresponding to the two doors
				of the heart, the fleshly and the spiritual.  In English
				some account (very imperfect) of zikr will be found in
				Hughe's Dictionary of Islam, covering over 14 columns.

				is best to avoid technical terms for things that are very
				different.  "Retaliation" in English has a wider meaning,

				more fitly apply to the blood-feuds of the Days of
				Ignorance.  Islam says: if you must take a life for a
				life, at least there should be some measure of equality
				in it; the killing of the slave of a tribe should not
				involve a blood feud where many free men would be killed;

				aggrieved party agrees, out of brotherly love. In meeting
				that demand the culprit or his friends should equally be
				generous and recognise the good-will of the other side.

				provide, and jurists have held that he has powers of
				disposition up to one-third of his property.  But he must
				not be partial to one heir at the expense of another, or
				attempt to defeat lawful creditors.  If he tries to do
				this, those who are witnesses to his oral disposition may
				interfere in two ways. One way would be to persuade the
				testator to change his bequest before he dies. The other
				way would be after death, to get the interested parties
				together and ask them to agree to a more equitable
				arrangement.  In such a case they are acting in good

				distance of 16 farsakhs, equivalent to 48 miles.  A
				journey of 8 or 9 miles on foot is more tiring than a

				of fatigue in riding a given distance on horseback or by
				camel or in a comfortable train or by motor car or by

				Haram - prohibited, sacred.  The month of Pilgrimage

				prohibited".  In Rajab, also, war was prohibited.  If the
				pagan enemies of Islam broke that custom and made war in
				the prohibited months, the Muslims were free also to
				break that custom but only to the same extent as the

				See ii. 158, n. 161.  The Hajj is the complete

				formal pilgrimage at any time of the year.  In either
				case, the intending pilgrim commences by putting on a
				simple garment of unsewn cloth in two pieces when he is
				some distance yet from Mecca.  The putting on of the
				pilgrim garb (ihram) is symbolical of his renouncing the
				vanities of the world.	After this and until the end of
				the pilgrimage he must not wear other clothes, or
				ornaments, anoint his hair, use perfumes, hunt, or do
				other prohibited acts. The completion of the pilgrimage

				The months well known: the months of Shawwal, Zul-qa'da,

				may begin as early as the beginning of Shawwal, with a

				concentrated on the first ten days of Zul-hijja, and
				specially on the 8th, 9th and 10th of that month, when
				the concourse of pilgrims reaches its height.  The chief
				rites may be briefly enumerated: (1) the wearing of the
				pilgrim garment (ihram) from certain points definitely
				fixed on all the roads to Mecca; after this the
				pilgrimage prohibitions come into operation and the
				pilgrim is dedicated to worship and prayer and the denial
				of vanities: (2) the going round the Ka'ba seven times
				(tawaf), typifying activity, with the kissing of the
				little Black Stone built into the wall, the symbol of
				concentration in the love of God; (3) After a short
				prayer at the Station of Abraham (Q. ii. 125), the
				pilgrim goes to the hills Safa and Marwa (Q. ii. 158),
				the symbols of patience and perserverance; (4) the great
				Sermon (Khutba) on the 7th of Zul-hijja, when the whole
				assembly listens to an exposition of the meaning of Hajj;
				(5) the visit on the eighth, of the whole body of
				pilgrims to the Valley of Mina (about six miles north of
				Mecca), where the pilgrims halt and stay the night,
				proceeding on the ninth to the plain and hill of Arafat,
				about five miles further north, which commemorates the
				reunion of Adam and Eve after their wanderings, and is
				also called the Mount of Mercy; (6) the tenth day, the Id
				Day, the day of Sacrifice, when the sacrifice is offered
				in the Valley of Mina, and the symbolic ceremony of
				casting seven stones at the Evil One is performed on the
				first occasion; it is continued on subsequent days; both
				rites are connected with the story of Abraham; this is
				the Id-ul-Adhha; note that the ceremony is symbolically
				connected with the rejection of evil in thought, word,
				and deed.  This closes the Pilgrimage, but a stay of two

				The next generation after Moses and Aaron was ruled by

				chequered history.  They were not united among
				themselves, and suffered many reverses at the hands of
				the Midianites, Amalekites and other tribes of Palestine.

				worship of the true God.  From time to time a leader
				appeared among them who assumed dictatorial powers.

				pointed out their backsliding, re-united them under His

				behind a sacred relic.	Nor can a sacred relic help the

				vii. 2.  Meanwhile the people pressed Samuel to appoint

				The three verses 258-260 have been the subject of much
				controversy as to the exact meaning to be attached to the
				incidents and the precise persons alluded to, whose names
				are not mentioned.  M.M.A's learned notes give some
				indication of the points at issue.  In such matters,
				where the Qur-an has given no names and the Holy Apostle
				has himself given no indication, it seems to me useless
				to speculate, and still worse to put forward positive
				opinions.  In questions of learning, speculations are
				often interesting.  But it seems to me that the meaning
				of the Qur-an is so wide and universal that we are in
				danger of missing the real and eternal meaning if we go
				on disputing about minor points.  All three incidents are
				such as may happen again and again in any prophet's
				lifetime, and be seen in impersonal vision at any time. 
				Here they are connected with Mustafa's vision as shown by
				the opening words of verse 258.

				The first point illustrated is the pride of power, and
				the impotence of human power as against God's power.  The
				person who disputed with Abraham may have been Nimrod or
				some ruler in Babylonia, or indeed elsewhere.  I name
				Babylonia as it was the original home of Abraham (Ur of
				the Chaldees), and Babylon prided herself on her arts and
				sciences in the ancient world.	Science can do many
				wonderful things; it could then; it can now.  But the
				mystery of Life baffled science then, as it continues to
				baffle science now, after many centuries of progress. 
				Abraham had faith and referred back everything to the
				true Cause of Causes.  A sceptical ruler might jestingly
				say: "I have the power of life and death".  A man of
				science might say: "We have investigated the laws of life
				and death."  Different kinds of powers lie in the hands
				of kings and men of knowledge.	The claim in both cases
				is true in a very limited sense.  But Abraham confounded
				the claimer by going back to fundamentals.  "If you had
				the ultimate power, why could you not make the sun rise

				A very high standard is set for charity.  (1) It must be

				According to the English proverb "Charity covers a
				multitude of sins".  Such a sentiment is strongly
				disapproved in Islam.  Charity has value only if (1)
				something good and valuable is given, (2) which has been
				honorably earned or acquired by the giver, or (3) which
				is produced in nature and can be referred to as a bounty
				of God.  (1) May include such things as are of use and
				value to others though they may be of less use to us or
				superfluous to us on account of our having acquired
				something more suitable for our station in life; for
				example, discarded clothes, or an old horse or a used
				motor car; but if the horse is vicious, or the car engine
				so far gone that it is dangerous to use, then the gift is
				worse than useless; it is positively harmful and the
				giver is a wrong-doer.	(2) Applies to fraudulent
				company-promoters, who earn great credit by giving away
				charity in some of their ill-gotten gains, or to robbers
				(even if they call themselves by high-sounding names) who
				"rob peter to pay Paul".  Islam will have nothing to do
				with tainted property.	Its economic code requires that
				every gain should be honest and honorable.  Even
				"charity" would not cover or destroy the taint.  (3) Lays
				down a test in cases of a doubtful gain.  Can we refer to
				it as a gift of God?  Obviously the produce of honest
				labour or agriculture can be so referred to.  In modern
				commerce and speculation there is much of quite the
				contrary character, and charity will not cover the taint.
				Some kind of art, skill, or talent are God-given:  it is
				the highest kind of charity to teach them or share their
				product.  Others are the contrary:  they are bad or
				tainted.  In the same way some professions or services

			(Charity is) for those in need who in Allah's cause are
			restricted (from travel) and cannot move about in the land
			seeking (for trade or work).  The ignorant man thinks because of
			their modesty that they are free from want.  Thou shalt know them

				Indiscriminate acts of so-called charity are condemned as
				they may do more harm than good (see ii 262).  The real
				beneficiaries of charity are here indicated. They must be
				in want.  And the want must be due to some honorable
				cause.	For example, they may be doing some unpaid
				service, such as teaching, or acquiring knowledge or
				skill, or be in exile for their faith, or in other ways
				be prevented from seeking employment or doing strenuous
				work.  "God's cause" must not be narrowly interpreted. 
				All sincere and real service to humanity comes within the
				definition.  Such men do not beg from door to door.  It
				is the duty of those who are well-to-do, or of the Public
				Purse, to find them out.

				Usury is condemned and prohibited in the strongest
				possible terms.  There can be no question about the
				prohibition.  When we come to the definition of Usury
				there is room for difference of opinion.  Hadhrat 'Umar,
				according to Ibn Kathir, felt some difficulty in the
				matter, as the Apostle left this world before the details
				of the question were settled.  This was one of the three
				questions on which he wished he had more light from the
				Prophet.  Our 'Ulama, ancient and modern, have worked out
				a great body of literature on Usury, based mainly on
				economic conditions as they existed at the rise of Islam.
			</note>
			<note id="325">
				An apt simile:	whereas legitimate trade or industry
				increases the prosperity and stability of men and
				nations, a dependence on Usury would merely encourage a
				race of idlers, cruel blood-suckers, and worthless
				fellows who do not know their own good and are therefore
				akin to madmen.

			<note id="326">
				Owing to the fact that interest occupies a central
				position in modern economic life, and specially since
				interest is the very life blood of the existing financial
				institutions, a number of Muslims have been inclined to
				interpret it in a manner which is radically different
				from the understanding of Muslim scholars throughout the
				last fourteen centuries and is also sharply in conflict
				with the categorical statements of the Prophet (peace be
				on him). According to Islamic teachings any excess on the
				capital is riba (interest). Islam accepts no distinction,
				in so far as prohibition is concerned, between reasonable
				and exorbitant rates of interest, and thus what came to
				be regarded as the difference between usury and interest;
				nor between returns on bonus for consumption and those
				for production purposes and so on.

			O ye who believe! when ye deal with each other in transactions

				The first part of the verse deals with transactions
				involving future payment or future consideration, and the
				second part with transactions in which payment and
				delivery are made on the spot.	Examples of the former
				are if goods are bought now and payment is promised at a
				fixed time and place in the future, or if cash is paid
				now and delivery is contracted for at a fixed time and
				place in the future.  In such cases a written document is
				recommended, but it is held that the words later on in
				this verse, that it is "juster . . . more suitable as
				evidence, and more convenient to prevent doubts", etc.
				imply that it is not obligatory in law.  Examples of the
				latter kind - cash payment and delivery on the spot -
				require no evidence in writing, but apparently oral
				witnesses to such transactions are recommended.
			</note>
			<note id="330">
				The scribe in such matters assumes a fiduciary capacity: 
				he should therefore remember to act as in the presence of
				God, with full justice to both parties. The art of
				writing he should look upon as a gift from God, and he
				should use it as in His service.  In an illiterate
				population the scribe's position is still more
				responsible.
			</note>
			<note id="331">
				Possibly the person "mentally deficient, or weak, or
				unable to dictate", may also be incapable of making a
				valid contract, and the whole duty would be on his
				guardian, who again must act in perfect good faith, not
				only protecting but vigilantly promoting  the interests
				of his ward.
			</note>
			<note id="332">
				It is desirable that the men (or women) who are chosen as
				witness should be from the circle to which the parties
				belong, as they would best be able to understand the
				transaction, and be most easily available if their
				evidence is required in future.
			</note>
			<note id="333">
				Commercial morality is here taught on the highest plane
				and yet in the most practical manner, both as regards the
				bargains to be made, the evidence to be provided, the
				doubts to be avoided, and the duties and rights of
				scribes and witnesses.	Probity even in worldly matters
				is to be, not a mere matter of convenience or policy, but
				a matter of conscience and religious duty.  Even our
				every-day transactions are to be carried out as in the
				presence of God.

			<note id="335">
				The law of Deposit implies great trust in the Depositary
				on the part of the Depositor.  The Depositary becomes a

				the interests of the person on whose behalf he holds the
				trust and to render back the property and accounts when
				required according to the terms of the trust.  This duty
				again is linked to the sanction of Religion, which

			<note id="336">
				It sometimes happens that if some inconvenient piece of

				a temptation.  The concealment of evidence has a serious
				effect on our own moral and spiritual life, for it taints
				the very source of higher life, as typified by the heart.
				 The heart is also the seat of our secrets.  We are told
				that the sin will reach our most secret being, though the
				sin may not be visible or open to the world.  Further,
				the heart is in the seat of our affections, and false
				dealing taints all our affections.

				In the year of Deputations, 10th of the Hijra, came a
				Christian embassy from Najran (towards Yaman, about 150
				miles north of Sanaa). They were much impressed on
				hearing this passage of the Qur-an explaining thc true
				position of Christ, and they entered into tributary
				relations with the new Muslim State. But ingrained habits
				and customs prevented them from accepting Islam as a
				body. The Holy Prophet, firm in his faith, proposed a
				Mubahala, i.e., a solemn meeting, in which both sides
				should summon not only their men, but their women and
				children, earnestly pray to Allah, and invoke the curse
				of Allah on those who should lie. Those who had a pure

				The battle of Uhud was a great testing time for the young
				Muslim community. Their mettle and the wisdom and
				strength of their Leader were shown in the battle of Badr
				(iii. 13 and note), in which the Makkan Pagans suffered a
				crushing defeat. The Makkans were determined to wipe off
				their disgrace and to annihilate the Muslims in Madinah.
				To this end they collected a large force and marched to
				Madinah. They numbered some 3,000 fighting men under Abu
				Sufyan, and they were so confident of victory that their
				women-folk came with them, and showed the most shameful
				savagery after the battle. To meet the threatened danger
				the Messenger of Allah, Muhammad Al-Mustafa, with his
				usual foresight, courage, and initiative, resolved to
				take his station at the foot of Mount Uhud, which
				dominates the city of Madinah some three miles to the
				north. Early in the morning, on the 7th of Shawwal, A.H.
				3 (January, 625), he made his dispositions for battle.
				Madinah winters are notoriously rigorous, but the
				warriors of Islam (700 to 1000 in number) were up early.
				A torrent bed was to their south, and the passes in the
				hills at their back were filled with 50 archers to
				prevent the enemy attack from the rear. The enemy were
				set the task of attacking the walls of Madinah, with the
				Muslims at their rear. In the beginning the battle went
				well for the Muslims. The enemy wavered, but the Muslim
				archers, in disobedience of their orders, left their
				posts to join in the pursuit and share in the booty.
				There was also treachery on the part of the 300
				"Hypocrites" led by Abdullah ibn Ubai, who deserted. The
				enemy took advantage of the opening left by the archers,
				and there was severe hand-to-hand fighting, in which
				numbers told in favour of the enemy. Many of the
				Companions and Helpers were killed. But there was no
				rout. Among the Muslim martyrs was the gallant Hamza, a
				brother of the Prophet's father. The graves of the
				martyrs are still shown at Uhud. The Messenger himself
				was wounded in his head and face, and one of his front
				teeth was broken. Had it not been for his firmness,
				courage, and coolness, all would have been lost. As it
				was, the prophet, in spite of his wound, and many of the
				wounded Muslims, inspired by his example, returned to the
				field next day, and Abu Sufyan and his Makkan army
				thought it most prudent to withdraw. Madinah was saved,
				but a lesson in faith, constancy, firmness, and
				steadfastness was learnt by the Muslims.

				It is want of faith that makes people afraid (1) of

				nearer to your goal, nor in meeting danger for a
				sufficient cause, because you know that the keys of life
				and death are in Allah's hands. Nothing can happen
				without Allah's Will. If it is Allah's Will that you
				should die, your staying at home will not save you. If it

				that you should lose your life in the danger, there are

				reaching Allah's Mercy; (2) the man of faith knows that
				he is not going to an unknown country of which he has no
				news; he is going nearer to Allah; and (3) he is being

				Burn sacrifices figured in the Mosaic Law, and in the

				true that the Mosaic Law laid down a fire from heavens on
				a burnt sacrifice as a test of the credentials of
				Prophets. Even if it had been so, did the Jews obey the

				are told a burnt offering prepared by Moses and Aaron:
				"and there came a fire out from before the Lord, and
				consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat."
				Yet the people rebelled frequently against Moses. Abel's
				offering (sacrifice) was probably a burnt offering: it
				was accepted by Allah, and he was killed by Cain out of
				jealousy: Gen. iv. 3-8. Mosaic sacrifices were no longer

				learning on this subject, and this body of law is enough
				by itself to form the subject of life-long study. Here we
				shall deal only with the broad principles to be gathered
				from the Text, as interpreted by the Jurists. (1) The
				power of testamentary disposition extends over only
				one-third of the Property; the remaining two-thirds are
				distributed among heirs as laid down. (2) All
				distribution takes place after the legacies and debts
				(including funeral expenses) have first been paid. (3)
				Legacies cannot be left to any of the heirs included in
				the scheme of distribution; or it will amount to
				upsetting the shares and undue preference of one heir to
				another. (4) Generally, but not always, the male takes a
				share double that of a female in his own category.

				At first sight, the Arabic words seem to mean: "if more
				than two daughters." But the alternative in the next
				clause is: "if only one daughter." Logically, therefore,
				the first clause must mean: "if daughters, two or more."
				This is the general interpretation, and is confirmed by
				the supplementary provision in iv. 176 at the end of the
				Sura, which should be read along with this.

			<note id="518">
				This verse deals with the portions allotted to (a)
				children, and (b) parents. The next verse deals with the
				portions allotted to (c) husband or wife of the deceased,
				and (d) collaterals. The children's shares are fixed, but
				their amount will depend upon what goes to the parents.
				If both parents are living, and there are also children,
				both father and mother take a sixth each: if only one
				parent is living, he or she takes his or her sixth; and
				the rest goes to the children. If the parents are living,
				and there is no child or other heir, the mother gets a
				third (and the father the remaining two-thirds); if there
				are no children, but there are brothers or sisters (this
				is interpreted strictly in the plural), the mother has a
				sixth, and the father apparently the residue, as the
				father excludes collaterals. This is far from being an
				exhaustive statement, but it establishes the proposition
				that children and parents have always some share if they
				survive, but their shares are affected by the existence
				and number of the heirs in these categories.

				"We disobey." Where they should have said respectfully,

				Life is absolutely sacred in the Islamic Brotherhood. But
				mistakes will sometimes happen, as did happen in the
				melee at Uhud, when some Muslims were killed (being
				mistaken for the enemy) by Muslims. There was no guilty
				intention: therefore there was no murder. But all the
				same, the family of the deceased was entitled to
				compensation unless they freely remitted it, and in
				addition it was provided that the unfortunate man who
				made the mistake should free a believing slave. Thus a
				deplorable mistake was made the occasion for winning the
				liberty of a slave who was a Believer, for Islam
				discountenances slavery. The compensation could only be
				paid if the deceased belonged to a Muslim society or to
				some people at peace with the Muslim society. Obviously
				it could not be paid if, though the deceased was a
				Believer, his people were at war with the Muslim society:
				even if his people could be reached, it is not fair to
				increase the resources of the enemy. If the deceased was
				himself an enemy at war, obviously the laws of war
				justify his being killed in warfare unless he
				surrendered. If the man who took life unintentionally has
				no means from which to free a believing slave or to give
				compensation, he must still by an act of strict
				self-denial (fasting for two whole months running) show
				that he is cognizant of the grave nature of the deed he
				has done and sincerely repentant. I take this to apply to
				all three cases mentioned: that is, where a Believer
				killed a Believer unintentionally and the deceased (1)
				belonged to the same community as you, or (2) belonged to
				a community at war with you, or (3) belonged to a

				but to prohibit evil. To make our assault we must be

				assault would be possible, and Allah's earth is spacious
				enough for the purpose. "Position" includes not only

				Rakats to two Rakats in Zuhr (midday prayer), 'Asr

				The Commentators explain this passage with reference to

				and when the trial was hot, he planted the stolen
				property into the house of a Jew, where it was found. The
				Jew denied the charge and accused Taima, but the
				sympathies of the Muslim community were with Taima on
				account of his nominal profession of Islam. The case was
				brought to the Prophet, who acquitted the Jew according
				to the strict principle of justice, as "guided by Allah."
				Attempts were made to prejudice him and deceive him into
				using his authority to favour Taima. When Taima realized
				that his punishment was imminent he fled and turned
				apostate. The general lesson is that the righteous man is
				faced with all sorts of subtle wiles; the wicked will try
				to appeal to his highest sympathies and most honourable
				motives to deceive him and use him as an instrument for
				defeating justice. He should be careful and cautious, and

				ill and repent, Allah will forgive; (2) if we do ill and
				do not repent: thinking that we can hide it, we are
				wrong; nothing is hidden from Allah, and we shall suffer
				the full consequences in the life to come, for we can
				never evade our personal responsibility: (3) if we do
				ill, great or small, and impute it to another, our
				original responsibility for the ill remains, but we add

				The unity, power, and goodness of Allah are so manifest
				in nature and in the human mind when it is in accord with
				the universal spirit, that only the most abject
				perversion can account for the sin of religious treason.
				That sin arises from perverted ideas of sex or perverted
				ideas of self. The perversion of sex is to suppose that
				sex rules in religious matters. From it arise such
				horrible creations of the imagination as Kali, the
				blood-thirsty goddess of India, or Hecate, the goddess of
				revenge and hate in Greek mythology. Even in beautiful
				forms like Saraswati (the goddess of learning) or Minerva
				(the virgin goddess of sport and arts), to say nothing of
				Venus (the goddess of carnal pleasures), the emphasis
				laid on sex destroys a right view of religious nature.
				Perverted ideas of self are typified in the story of
				Satan, who was so puffed up with arrogance that he
				disobeyed Allah, and Allah cursed him. Both these
				perversions, if allowed lodgment, completely ruin our
				religious nature and deface Allah's handiwork. Hence it

			</note>
			<note id="637">
				Cf. iv. 75. n. 592. Both widows and orphans are to be
				helped because they are ordinarily weak, ill-treated, and

				on brute strength, the weaker go to the wall, and public
				opinion expects nothing else. In Nietzsche's philosophy

				some of the militarist nations in our own time seem
				inclined to support this reversion to our primitive
				instincts. Even in modern democracies of the saner sort,
				we are often told that it is the fate of minorities to
				suffer; strength of numbers here becomes the passport to
				power and privilege. Islam, while upholding sane manly
				views in general, enjoins the most solicitous care for
				the weak and oppressed in every way-in rights of

				opportunities of development. Spiritual strength or

				The end of the life of Jesus on earth is as much involved
				in mystery as his birth, and indeed the greater part of
				his private life, except the three main years of his
				ministry. It is not profitable to discuss the many doubts
				and conjectures among the early Christian sects and among
				Muslim theologians. The Orthodox Christian Churches make
				it a cardinal point of their doctrine that his life was
				taken on the Cross, that he died and was buried, that on
				the third day he rose in the body with his wounds intact,
				and walked about and conversed, and ate with his
				disciples, and was afterwards taken up bodily to heaven.
				This is necessary for the theological doctrine of blood
				sacrifice and vicarious atonement for sins, which is
				rejected by Islam. But some of the early Christian sects
				did not believe that Christ was killed on the Cross. The
				Basilidans believed that some one else was substituted
				for him. The Docetae held that Christ never had a real
				physical or natural body, but only an apparent or phantom
				body, and that his Crucifixion was only apparent, not
				real. The Marcionite Gospel (about A.D. 138) denied that
				Jesus was born, and merely said that he appeared in human
				form. The Gospel of St. Barnabas supported the theory of
				substitution on the Cross. The Quranic teaching is that
				Christ was not crucified nor killed by the Jews,
				notwithstanding certain apparent circumstances which
				produced that illusion in the minds of some of his
				enemies: that disputations, doubts, and conjectures on
				such matters are vain; and that he was taken up to Allah
				(see next verse and note).

				before the Final Day, after the coming of the Mahdi, when
				the world will be purified of sin and unbelief. There
				will be a final death before the final Resurrection, but

				This verse supplements the rule of inheritance of the
				estate of a deceased person who has left as heir neither
				a descendant nor an ascendant. We shall call such a
				person A, who may be either a male or a female. In iv. 12
				(second half), A's case was considered where he had left
				uterine brothers or sisters. Here A's case is considered
				where he has left brothers and or sisters by the father's
				side, whether the mother was the same or not. "Brothers"
				and "sisters" in this verse must be construed to be such
				brothers and sisters. For the sake of clearness, I have
				expanded the terse language of the original in the
				translation. Let me explain it more concretely in this

				defined as above, we proceed to consider how A's
				inheritance would be divided. If A left a widow or
				widower, the widow's or widower's share would first be
				calculated as in the first half of iv. 12; if A left no
				spouse, this calculation would not be necessary. Then if
				A left a single "sister," she would have a half share,
				the remaining half (in so for as it, or a part of it,
				does not fall to a spouse, if any) going to remoter
				heirs: if a single "brother," he would have the whole
				(subject to the spouse's right if there is a spouse); if
				more than one "brother," they divide the whole (subject
				to etc.). If A left two or more "sisters," they get
				between them two-thirds, subject to the spouse's right,
				if any. If A left a "brother" and "sister," or "brothers"
				and "sisters," they divide on the basis that each
				"brother's" share is twice that of the "sister" (subject
				to, etc.). In all cases debts, funeral expenses, and
				legacies (to the amount allowed) have priority as in n.

				faculty of knowledge and foresight: besides the intuition
				and reason which He gave us. He made Nature responsive to
				our needs, and His Signs in Nature are so many lessons to
				us in our own inner life; He further sent Messengers and
				Teachers, for the guidance of our conduct in individual,
				social, and public life. All these gifts create
				corresponding obligations which we must fulfil. But in
				our own human and material life we undertake mutual
				obligations express and implied. We make a promise: we
				enter into a commercial or social contract; we enter into
				a contract of marriage: we must faithfuly fulfil all
				obligations in all these relationships. Our group or our
				State enters into a treaty; every individual in that
				group or State is bound to see that as far as lies in his
				power, such obligations are faithfully discharged. There
				are tacit obligations; living in civil society, we must
				respect its tacit conventions unless they are morally
				wrong, and in that case we must get out of such society.
				There are tacit obligations in the characters of host and
				guest, wayfarer of companion, employer or employed, etc.,
				etc., which every man of Faith must discharge
				conscientiously. The man who deserts those who need him
				and goes to pray in a desert is a coward who disregards
				his obligations. All these obligations are
				inter-connected. Truth and fidelity are parts of religion
				in all relations of life. This verse is numbered

				We now come to the events detailed in the 13th and 1th
				chapters of the Book of Numbers in the Old Testament.
				Read these as a Commentary, and examine a good map of the
				Sinai Peninsula, showing its connections with Egypt on
				the west, North-West Arabia on the east, and Palestine on
				the north-east. We may suppose that Israel crossed from
				Egypt into the Peninsula somewhere near the northern
				extremity of the Gulf of Suez. Moses organised and
				numbered the people, and instituted the Priesthood. They
				went south about 200 miles to Mount Sinai where the Torah
				was received. Then, perhaps a hundred and fifty miles
				north, was the desert of Paran, close to the southern
				borders of Canaan. From the camp there twelve men were
				sent to spy out the land, and they penetrated as far as
				Hebron, say about 150 miles north of their camp, about 20
				miles south of the future Jerusalem. They saw a rich
				country, and brought from it pomegranates and figs and a
				bunch of grapes so heavy that it had to be carried by two
				men on a staff. They came back and reported that the land
				was rich, but the men there were too strong for them. The
				people of Israel had no courage and no faith, and Moses
				remonstrated with them.

				Here, as in Sura Al-Baqarah (ii. 62), the Qur-an
				underscores the importance of true and genuine faith,
				which is to be judged by a sincere belief in Allah and
				man's accountability to Him backed by a righteous conduct
				rather than by mere forms or labels. At both the places
				it repudiates the false claims of the People of the Book
				that they had a special relationship with Allah for they
				were the children of Abraham; that they were a chosen
				people with special privileges, and no matter what they
				did, their high status would remain unaffected. Here this
				false notion is refuted and the People of the Book are
				being reminded that it is through sincere belief and
				righteous conduct rather than pretentious claims that man
				can win his Lord's pleasure and achieve ultimate success.
				The verse does not purport to lay down an exhaustive list
				of the articles of faith. Nor does it seek to spell out
				the essentials of a genuine belief in Allah, which has no
				meaning unless it is accompanied by belief in His
				Prophets for it is through their agency alone that we
				know Allah's Will and can abide by it in our practical
				lives. This is especially true of His final Prophet,
				Muhammad (peace be on him) whose message is universal,
				and not confined to any particular group or section of
				humanity. Belief in the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace be
				on him) is thus an integral part and a logical corollary
				of belief in Allah. Moreover, it is also an essential
				test of genuineness of such belief. This becomes clear
				when the verse is read in conjunction with other relevant
				verses of the Qur-an. See, for instance, iv. 170, v. 15,
				19, vii. 157, 158, xxi. 107, xxv. I, xxxiii, 40, lxi. 6.

				There is a subtle symphony in what appears at first sight

				explained vis-a-vis man's higher duties. Baidhawi is
				right in classifying such duties under three heads; those
				due to Allah, those due from a man to himself (his
				self-respect), and those due to other creatures of Allah.
				Or perhaps all duties have this threefold aspect. The
				first may be called Believing or Faith; the second,
				Guarding ourselves from evil, or Conscience: and the
				third, doing good or Righteousness. But the simplest
				physical rules, e.g., those about eating, cleanliness,
				etc., if they are good, refer also to the higher aspects.
				If we eat bad food, we hurt ourselves, we cause offence
				to our neighbours, and we disobey Allah. If we have faith
				and righteousness, are we likely to be wanting in
				conscience? If we have conscience and faith, are we
				likely to fail in righteousness? If we have conscience
				and righteousness, what can be their foundation but

				there were wicked kings, and other nations were pressing
				in on them; but he performed many miracles, and some
				check was given to the enemies under his advice. The
				story of Jonas (Yunus) is well-known: he was swallowed by
				a fish or whale, but was saved by God's mercy: through
				his preaching, his city (Ninevah) was saved (x. 98). Lot

				Some of the various ideas connected with "creation" are

				man there are various processes. If his body was created
				out of clay, i.e. earthy matter, there was an earlier
				preocess of the creation of such earthy matter. Here the
				body is left behind, and the soul is being addressed. The
				soul underwent various processes of fashioning and
				adapting to its various functions in its various
				surroundings (xxxii. 7-9). But each individual soul, afer
				release from the body, comes back as it was created, with
				nothing more than it history, "the deeds which it has
				earned," which are really a part of it. Any exterior
				things given to help in its development, "the favours
				which We bestowed on you," it must necessarily leave
				behind, however it may have been proud of them. These
				exterior things may be material things, e.g. wealth,
				property, signs of power, influence and pride such as
				sons, relatives, and friends, etc., or they may be

				Another beautiful nature passage, referring to God's
				wonderful artistry in His Creation. In how few and how
				simple words, the whole pageant of Creation is placed
				before us. Beginning from our humble animal needs and
				dependence on the vegetable world, we are asked to
				contemplate the interaction of the living and the dead.
				Here is mystic teaching, referring not only to physical
				life but to the higher life above the physical plane,
				-not only to individual life but to the collective life
				of nations. Then we take a peep into the daily miracle of
				morning, noon, and night, and pass on to the stars that
				guide the distant mariner. We rise still higher to the
				mystery of the countless individuals from the one human
				soul, -their sojourn and their destiny. So we get back to
				the heavens: the description of th luscious fruits which
				the "gentle rain from heaven" produces, leaves us to
				contemplate the spiritual fruits which faith will provide
				for us,with the aid of the showers of God's mercy.
			</note>
			<note id="919">
				The seed-grain and the date-stone are selected as types
				in the vegetable kingdom, showing how our physical life
				depends on it. The fruits mentioned later (in vi 99)
				start another allegory which we shall notice later.
				Botanists will notice that the seed-grain includes the
				cereals (such as wheat, barley, rice, millet, etc.) which
				are monocotyledons, as well as the pulses (such as beans,
				peas, gram, etc.) and other seeds which are dicotyledons.
				These two represent the most important classes of
				food-grains, while the date-palm, a monocotyledon,
				represents for Arabia both food, fruit, confectionery ,
				thatch and pillars for houses, shady groves in oases, and
				a standard measure of wealth and well being. "Split and
				sprout": both ideas are included in the root falaqa, and
				a third is expressed by the word "cleave" in the next
				verse, for the action of evolving day-break from the
				dark. I might almost have used the word "churn," familiar
				to students of Hindu lore in the Hindu allegory of the
				"churning of the ocean." For vegetables, "split and
				sprout" represents a double process: (1) the seed
				divides, and (2) one part shoots up, seeking the light,
				and forming leaves and the visible parts of the future
				tree, and the other part digs down into the dark, forming
				the roots and seeking just that sustenance from the soil,
				which is adapted for the particular plant. This is just
				one small instance of the "judgement and ordering" of
				God, referred to in the next verse.

			<note id="920">
				This does not mean that in physical nature there are no
				limits between life and non-life, between the organic and
				the non-organic. In fact physicists are baffled at the
				barrier between them and frankly confess that they cannot
				solve the mystery of Life. If there is such a barrier in
				physical nature, is it not all the more wonderful that
				God can create Life out of nothing? He has but to say,
				"Be," and it is. He can bring Life from non-Life and
				annihilate Life. But there are two other senses in which
				we can contemplate the contrast between the living and
				the dead. (1) We have just been speaking of the botanical
				world. Take it as a whole, and see the contrast between
				the winter of death, the spring of revivification, the
				summer of growth, and the autumn of decay, leading back
				to the death of winter. Here is a cycle of living from
				dead, and dead from living. (2) Take our spiritual life,
				individual or collective. We rise from the darkness of
				spiritual nothingness to the light of spiritual life. And
				if we do not follow the spiritual laws, God will take
				away that life and we shall be again as dead. We may die
				many deaths. The keys of life and death are in God's
				hands. Neither Life nor Death are fortuitous things.
				Behind them both is the Cause of Causes, -and only He.

				A man's actual personal religion depends upon many
				things, -his personal psychology, the background of his
				life, his hidden or repressed feelings, tendencies, or
				history (which psychoanalysis tries to unravel), his
				hereditary dispositions or antipathies, and all the
				subtle influences of his education and his environment.
				The task before the man of God is: (1) to use any of
				these which can subserve the higher ends, (2) to purify
				such as have been misused, (3) to introduce new ideas and
				modes of looking at things, and (4) to combat what is
				wrong and cannot be mended: all for the purpose of
				leading to the truth and gradually letting in spiritual
				light where there was darkness before. If that is not
				done with discretion and the skill of a spiritual
				Teacher, there may be not only a reaction of obstinacy,
				but an unseemly show of dishonour to the true God and His
				Truth, and doubts would spread among the weaker brethren
				whose faith is shallow and infirm. What happens to
				individuals is true collectively of nations or groups of
				people. They think in their self-obsession that their own
				ideas are right. God in His infinite compassion bears
				with them, and asks those who have purer ideas of faith
				not to vilify the weaknesses of their neighbours, lest
				the neighbours in their turn vilify the real truth and
				make matters even worse than before. In so far as there
				is active evil, He will deal with it in His own way. Of

			For those who followed the Jewish Law We forbade every (animal)
			with undivided hoof and We forbade them the fat of the ox and the
			sheep except what adheres to their backs or their entrails or is
			mixed up with a bone: this in recompense for their wilful
			disobedience: for We are True (in Our ordinances). <fn>970</fn>
			<fn>971</fn>
			<note id="970">
				Zufur may mean claw or hoof; it is in the singular
				number; but as no animal has a single claw, and there is
				no point in a division of claws, we must look to a hoof
				for the correct interpretation. In the Jewish Law
				(Leviticus, xi. 3-6), "Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and
				is cloven-footed, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts"
				was lawful as food, but the camel, the coney (rabbit),
				and the hare were not lawful, because they do not "divide
				the hoof". "Undivided hoof" therefore is the correct
				interpretation. These three animals, unlawful to the
				Jews, are lawful in Islam. Cf. iv. 160.
			</note>
			<note id="971">
				In Leviticus (vii. 23) it is laid down that "ye shall eat
				no manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep or of goat." As
				regards the exceptions, it is to be noticed that priests
				were enjoined (Leviticus, vii. 6) to eat of the fat in
				the trespass of offering, which was considered holy,
				viz., "the rump" (back and bone) "and the fat that
				covereth the inwards" (entrails), (Leviticus, vii.3).

			Those who give partners to Allah will say "If Allah had wished we

			<note id="972">
				As used by the Pagans, the argument is false, for it
				implies (a) that men have no personal responsibility, (b)
				that they are the victims of a Determinism against which
				they are helpless, and (c) that they might therefore go
				on doing just what they liked. It is also inconsistent,

				On the other hand, the argument cuts true and deep, as
				from God to His creatures. God is Omnipotent, and can do

				man some responsibility, and some choice in order to
				train man's will. If man fails, he is helped in various
				ways by God's mercy and grace. But man cannot go on
				sinning, and in a state of sin, expect God to be pleased

				Instead of following Pagan superstitions, and being in
				constant terror of imaginary taboos and prohibitions, we
				should study the true moral law, whose sanction is God's
				Law. The first step is that we should recognise that He
				is the One and Only Lord and Cherisher. The mention of
				goodness to parents immediately afterwards suggests: (1)
				that God's love of us and care for us may -on an
				infinitely higher plane- be understood by our ideal of
				parental love, which is purely unselfish; (2) that our
				first duty among our fellow creatures is to our father
				and mother, whose love leads us to the conception of
				divine love. Arising from that is the conception of our
				converse duties to our children. God provides sustenance
				(material and spiritual) not only for us, but for them;
				hence any custom like the Pagan custom of sacrificing
				children of Moloch stands condemned. Then come the moral
				prohibitions against lewdness and all unseemly acts,
				relating to sex or otherwise, open or secret. This is
				followed by the prohibition of killing or fighting. All
				these things are conformable to our own interests, and
				therefore true wisdom from our own point of view.

				For the comprhensive word haqq I have used the two words

				human life is sacred, but all life is sacred. Even in
				killing animals for food, a dedicatory formula "in the

				The 'Ad people, with their prophet Had, are mentioned in
				many places. See especially xxvi. 123-140, and xivi.
				21-26. Their story belongs to Arabian tradition. Their
				eponymous ancestor 'Ad was fourth in generation from
				Noah, having been a son of 'Aus, the son of Aram, the son
				of Sam, the son of Noah. They occupied a large tract of
				country in Southern Arabia, extending from Umman at the
				mouth of the Arabian Gulf to Hadhramaut and Yemen at the
				southern end of the Red Sea. The people were tall in
				stature and were great builders. Probably the long,
				winding tracts of sands (ahqaf) in their dominions (xivi.
				21) were irrigated with canals. They forsook the true
				God, and oppressed their people. A three years famine
				visited them, but yet they took no warning. At length a
				terrible blast of wind destroyed them and their land, but
				a remnant, known as the second 'Ad or the Thamud (see
				below) were saved, and afterwards suffered a similar fate
				for their sins. The tomb of the Prophet Hud (qabr Nabi
				Hud) is still traditionally shown in Hadhramaut, latitude

				The Thamud people were the successors to the culture and
				civilization of the 'Ad people, for whom see n. 1040 and
				vii. 65 above. They were cousins to the 'Ad, apparently a
				younger branch of the same race. Their story also belongs
				to Arabian tradition, according to which their eponymous
				ancestor Thamud was a son of 'Abir (a brother of Aram),
				the son of Sam, the son of Noah. Their seat was in the
				north-west corner of Arabia (Arabia Petraea), between
				Madinah and Syria. It included both rocky country (hijr.
				xv. 80), and the spacious fertile valley (Wadi) and
				plains country of Qura, which begins just north of the
				City of Madinah and is traversed by the Hijaz Railway.
				When the holy Prophet in the 9th year of the Hijra led
				his expedition to Tabuk (about 400 miles north of
				Madinah) against the Roman forces, on a reported Roman
				invasion from Syria, he and his men came across the
				archaeological remains of the Thamud. The recently
				excavated rock city of Petra, near Maan, may go back to
				the Thamud, though its architecture has many features
				connecting it with Egyptian and Graeco-Roman culture
				overlaying what is called by European writers Nabataean
				Culture. Who were the Nabataeans? They were an old Arab
				tribe which played a considerable part in history after
				they came into conflict with Antigonus I in 312 B.C.
				Their capital was Petra, but they extended their
				territory right up to the Euphrates. In 85 B.C. they were
				lords of Damascus under their king Haritha (Aretas of
				Roman history). For some time they were allies of the
				Roman Empire and held the Red Sea littoral. The Emperor
				Trajan reduced them and annexed their territory in A.D.
				105. The Nabataeans succeeded the Thamud of Arabian
				tradition. The Thamud are mentioned by name in an
				inscription of the Assyrian King Sargon, dated 715 B.C.,
				as a people of Eastern and Central Arabia (Encyclopaedia
				of Islam). See also Appendix VII to S. xxvi. With the
				advance of material civilisation, the Thamud people
				became godless and arrogant, and were destroyed by an
				earthquake. Their prophet and warner was Salih, and the
				crisis in their history is connected with the story of a
				wonderful she-camel: see next note.
			</note>
			<note id="1044">
				The story of this wonderful she-camel, that was a sign to
				the Thamud, is variously told in tradition. We need not
				follow the various versions in the traditional story.
				What we are told in the Qur-an is: that (1) she was a
				Sign or Symbol, which the prophet Salih, used for a
				warning to the haughty oppressors of the poor: (2) there
				was scarcity of water, and the arrogant or privileged
				classes tried to prevent the access of the poor or their
				cattle to the springs, while Salih intervened on their
				behalf (xxvi. 155, liv. 28); (3) like water, pasture was
				considered a free gift of nature, in this spacious earth
				of Allah (vii. 73), but the arrogant ones tried to
				monopolise the pasture also; (4) this particular
				she-camel was made a test case (liv. 27) to see if the
				arrogant ones would come to reason; (5) the arrogant
				ones, instead of yielding to the reasonable rights of the
				people, ham-strung the poor she- camel and slew her,
				probably secretly (xci. 14, liv. 29): the cup of their
				iniquities was full, and the Thamud people were destroyed
				by a dreadful earthquake, which threw them prone on the
				ground and buried them with their houses and their fine
				buildings.

				cannot be exactly located, but it may be supposed that
				they were somewhere in the plain cast of the Dead Sea.
				The story of their destruction is told in the 19th
				chapter of Genesis. Two angels in the shape of handsome
				young men came to Lot in the evening and became his
				guests by night. The inhabitants of Sodom in their lust
				for unnatural crime invaded Lot's house but were

				and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which

			<note id="1053">
				"Madyan" may be identified with "Midian". Midian and the
				Midianites are frequently mentioned in the Old Testament,
				though the particular incident here mentioned belongs to
				Arab rather than to Jewish tradition. The Midianites were
				of Arab race, though, as neighbours of the Canaanites,
				they probably intermixed with them. They were a wandering
				tribe: it was Midianite merchants to whom Joseph was sold
				into slavery, and who took him to Egypt. Their principal
				territory in the time of Moses was in the northeast of
				the Sinai Peninsula, and east of the Amalekites. Under
				Moses the Israelites waged a war of extermination against
				them: they slew the kings of Midian, slaughtered all the
				males, burnt their cities and castles, and captured their
				cattle (Num. xxxi, 7-1 1). This sounds like total
				extermination. Yet a few generations afterwards, they
				were so powerful that the Israelites for their sins were
				delivered into the captivity of the Midianites for seven
				years: both the Midianites and their camels were without
				number: and the Israelites hid from them in "dens.....
				caves, and strongholds" (Judges vii. 1- 6). Gideon
				destroyed them again, (Judges vii. 1-25), say about two
				centuries after Moses. As the decisive battle was near
				the hill of Moreh, not far south of Mount Tabor, we may
				localise the Midianites on this occasion in the northern
				parts of the Jordan valley, at least 200 miles north of
				the Sinai Peninsula. This and the previous destruction
				under Moses were local, and mention no town of Midian. In
				later times there was a town of Madyan on the cast side
				of the Gulf of 'Aqaba. It is mentioned in Josephus,
				Eusebius, and Ptolemy: (Encyclopaedia of Islam). Then it
				disappears from geography. In Muslim times it was a
				revived town with quite a different kind of population,
				but it never flourished. The Midianites disappeared from
				history.
			</note>
			<note id="1054">
				Shu'aib belongs to Arab rather than to Jewish tradition,
				to which he is unknown. His identification with Jethro,
				the father-in-law of Moses, has no warrant, and I reject
				it. There is no similarity either in names or incidents,
				and there are chronological difficulties (see n. 1064
				below). If, as the Commentators tell us, Shuaib was in
				the fourth generation from Abraham, being a
				great-grandson of Madyan (a son of Abraham), he would be
				only about a century from the time of Abraham, whereas
				the Hebrew Bible would give us a period of four to six
				centuries between Abraham and Moses. The mere fact that
				Jathro was a Midianite and that another name, Hobab, is
				mentioned for a father-in-law of Moses in Num x. 29, is
				slender ground for identificaion. As the Midianites were
				mainly a nomad tribe, we need not be surprised that their
				destruction in one or two settlements did not affect
				their life in wandering sections of the tribe in other
				geographical regions. Shu'aib's mission was apparently in
				one of the settled towns of the Midianites, which was
				completely destroyed by an earthquake (vii. 91). If this
				happened in the century after Abraham, there is no
				difficulty in supposing that they were again a numerous
				tribe, three or five centuries later, in the time of
				Moses (see last note). As they were a mixed wandering
				tribe, both their resilience and their eventual
				absorption can be easily understood. But the destruction
				of the settlement or settlements (if the Wood or Aika was
				a separate settlement, see n. 2000 to xv. 78) to which
				Shu'aib was sent to preach was complete, and no traces of
				it now remain. The name of the highest mountain of Yemen,
				Nabi Shu'aib (11,000 ft.) has probably no connection with
				the geographical territory of the nomad Midianites,
				unless we suppose that their wanderings extended so far
				south from the territories mentioned in the last note.

				The Midianites were in the path of a commercial highway
				of Asia, viz., that between two such opulent and highly
				organised nations as Egypt and the Mesopotamian group
				comprising Assyria and Babylonia. Their besetting sins
				are thus characterised here: (1) giving short measure or
				weight, whereas the strictest commercial probity is
				necessary for success, (2) a more general form of such
				fraud, depriving people of rightful dues, (3) producing
				mishchief and disorder, whereas peace and order had been
				established (again in a literal as well as a metaphorical
				sense); (4) not content with upsetting settled life,
				taking to highway robbery, literally as well as (5)
				metaphorically, in two ways, viz., cutting off people
				from access to the worship of Allah, and abusing religion
				and piety for crooked purposes, i.e., exploiting religion
				itself for their crooked ends, as when a man builds
				houses of prayer out of unlawful gains or ostentatiously
				gives charity out of money which he has obtained by force
				or fraud, etc. After setting out this catalogue of
				besetting sins Shu'aib makes two appeals to the past: (1)
				You began as an insignificant tribe, and by Allah's
				favour you increased and multiplied in numbers and
				resources: do you not then owe a duty to Allah to fulfil
				His Law? (2) What was the result in the case of those who
				fell into sin? Will you not take warning by their
				example? So Shu'aib began his argument with faith in
				Allah as the source of all virtue, and ended it with
				destruction as the result of all sin. In the next verse
				he pleads with them to end their controversies and come
				to Allah.

				selfishness, arrogance, violence, lawlessness, and
				injustice. But he appeals to their better nature, and is
				prepared to argue on the basis that the party which wants
				to suppress those who believe in God's Message and in
				righteousness, has some sincere mental difficulty in
				accepting Shu'aib's mission, "If," he says to them, "that

				perseverance. His argument to them would be: "You have
				faith; surely your faith is strong enough to sustain you
				in the hope that Allah's truth will triumph in the end;

				cover of religion, and so on! Perhaps the righteous were
				the poor and the weak. Were they likely to love such

				The answer of the righteous is threefold. (1) "Coming

			But the earthquake took them unawares and they lay prostrate in
			their homes before the morning! <fn>1063</fn>
			<note id="1063">
				The fate of the Madyan people is described in the same
				terms as that of the Thamud in verse 78 above. An
				earthquake seized them by night, and they were buried in
				their own homes, no longer to vex Allah's earth. But a
				supplementary detail is mentioned in xxvi. 189, "the
				punishment of a day of overshadowing gloom," which may be
				understood to mean a shower of ashes and cinders
				accompanying a volcanic eruption. Thus a day of terror
				drove them into their homes, and the earthquake finished
				them. The lament of Shu'aib in verse 93 is almost the
				same as that of Salih in verse 79, with two differences:
				(1) Shu'aib's messages attacked the many sins of his
				people (see n. 1055) and are, therefore, expressed in the
				plural, while Salih's fight was chiefly against selfish
				arrogance, and his message is expressed in the singular;
				(2) the Thamud were the more cultured people of the two,
				and perished in their own pride; as Salih said, "ye love
				not good counsellors"; the Midianites were a rougher
				people, and their minds were less receptive of argument
				or faith; as Shu'aib said, they were a people who
				"refused to believe."

			<note id="1064">
				Can we get any idea of the chronological place of the
				destruction of the Midianites? In n. 1053 (vii. 85) we
				have discussed the geographical aspects. The following
				considerations will help us in getting some idea of their
				period. (1) The stories of Noah, Hud, Salih, Lut, and
				Shu'aib seem to be in chronological order. Therefore
				Shu'aib came after Abraham, whose nephew Lut was. (2) If
				Shu'aib was in the fourth generation from Abraham, (see
				n. 1590 to xi. 80), it would be impossible for him to
				have been a contemporary of Moses, who came many
				centuries later. This difficulty is recognised by Ibn
				Kathir and other classical commentators. (3) The
				identification of Shu'aib with Jethro the father-in-law
				of Moses is without warrant; see n. 1054 (vii. 85). (4)
				Shu'aib must have been before Moses; see vii. 103. (5)
				The Midianites who were destroyed by Moses and by Gideon
				after him (n. 1053) were local remnants, as we may speak
				of the Jews at the present day; but their existence as a
				nation in their original home-lands seems to have ended
				before Moses: "they became as if they had never been in
				the homes where they had flourished" (vii. 92). (6)
				Josephus, Eusebius, and Ptolemy mention a town of Madyan,
				but it was not of any importance (n. 1053). (7) After the
				first centuries of the Christian era, Madyan as a town
				appears as an unimportant place resting on its past.

				The story of Moses is told in many places in the Holy
				Qur-an, with a special lesson in each context. In ii.
				49-71, the story is an appeal to the Jews from their own
				scripture and traditions, to show their true place in the
				religious history of mankind, and how they forfeited it.
				Here we have an instructive parallelism in that story to
				the story of Muhammad's mission,-how both these men of
				Allah had to fight against (1) a foreign foe, arrogant,
				unjust, faithless, and superstitious, and (2) against the
				same class of internal foe among their own people. Both
				of them won through. In the case of Moses, the foreign
				foe was Pharaoh and his Egyptians, who boasted of their
				carlier and superior civilisation; in the case of the
				Prophet Muhammad the foreign foes were the Jews
				themselves and the Christians of his day. Moses led his
				people nearly to the land of promise in spite of
				rebellions among his own people; Muhammad succecded
				completely in overcoming the resistance of his own people

				"Pharaoh" (Arabic, Fir'aun) is a dynastic title, not the

				"Great House." The nun is an "infirm" letter added in the
				process of Arabisation. Who was the Pharaoh in the story
				of Moses? If the Inscriptions had helped us, we could
				have answered with some confidence, but unfortunately the
				Inscriptions fail us. It is probable that it was an early
				Pharaoh of the XVIIIth Dynasty, say Thothmes 1, about
				1540 B.C. See appendix IV on Egyptian Chronology and

				Notice that Moses, in addressing Pharaoh and the
				Egyptians, claims his mission to be not from his God, or
				his people's God but from "your Lord," from "the Lord of

				"I come unto you (Egyptian people) from your Lord." "The
				spirit of our version is entirely different from the
				spirit of the same story as told in the Old Testament
				(Exod. chapters i. to xv.). In Exod. iii. 18, the mission
				of Moses is expressed to be as from "the Lord God of the
				Hebrews." The essence of the whole Islamic story is this:
				Joseph's sufferings and good fortune were not merely a
				story in a romance. Joseph was a prophet; his sufferings
				and his subsequent rise to power and position in Egypt
				were to be a lesson (a) to his wicked brothers who sold
				him into slavery, (b) to his people who were stricken
				with famine and found a welcome in Egypt, and (c) to the
				Egyptians, who were arrogant over their high material
				civilisation, but had yet to be taught the pure faith of
				Abraham. Israel prospered in Egypt, and stayed there
				perhaps two to four centuries. (Renan allows only one
				century). Times changed, and the racial bigotry of the
				Egyptians showed its head again, and Israel was
				oppressed. Moses was raised up with a threefold mission
				again (a) to learn all the learning of the Egyptians and
				preach Allah's Truth to them as one who had been brought
				up among themselves, (b) to unite and reclaim his own
				people, and (c) to rescue them and lead them to a new
				world, which was to open out their spiritual horizon and
				lead them to the Psalms of David and the glories of
				Solomon.

				Put down the Tablets: we are not told that the Tablets

				waxed hot, and he cast the tablets out of his hands, and
				brake them beneath the Mount." (Exod. xxxii. 10). On this

				an altar before the calf (Exd. xxxii. 2-5), our version

				free from any such taint, just as a clean slate is
				necessary if a perfectly clear and bold message has to be

				time. Adam's seed carries on the existence of Adam and
				succeeds to his spiritual heritage. Humanity has been

				possession creates on our side special spiritual
				obligations which we must faithfully discharge: see v. 1.
				and n. 682. These obligations may from a legal point of

				life, the life eternal, even though it may apparently

				Trusts may be of various kinds: (1) property, goods,

				A big family-many sons-was considered a source of power

				the man that hath his quiver full of them; they shall not
				be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the
				gate." So with property and possessions: they add to a
				man's dignity, power, and influence. But both possessions
				and a large family are a temptation and a trial. They may
				turn out to be a source of spiritual downfall, if they
				are mishandled, or if the love of them excludes the love

				This was actually a challenge thrown out by the Infidels

				he-the Mercy of the Worlds-conferred a certain amount of
				immunity to them. There were also other Muslims, just men
				who asked for forgiveness. And Allah keeps the door of
				repentance and forgiveness open to all as long as they
				make it possible. But let them not be puffed up with
				pride, or think that they have lasting immunity. What
				became of Abu Jahl? He and some of his greatest warriors
				were slain at Badr. The little autocratic clique that

				has no place in such warfare. At the same time, if there

				taken, and it would be for the Imam to exercise his

				to say: "Think not that I am come to send peace on earth:
				I came not to send peace but a sword." (Matt. x. 34).

				'Amara as applied to mosques implies the following ideas:
				(1) to build or repair: (2) to maintain in fitting
				dignity: (3) to visit for purposes of devotion: and (4)
				fill with light and life and activity. For brevity I have
				only used "maintain" in the Translation. Before the
				preaching of Islam the Pagans built, repaired, and
				maintained the Mosque, and celebrated Pagan ceremonies in
				it. They made an income out of it. Islam protested, and
				the Pagans ejected Muslims and their Leader from Makkah
				and shut them out from the Ka'ba itself. When the Muslims
				were strong enough to re-take Makkah (A.H. 8), they
				purified the Mosque and re-established the worship of the
				true God. If they became Muslims, it was a different
				matter. The further question arose: should they be
				allowed to visit it and practise their unseemly Pagan
				rites? Obviously this would be derogatory to the dignity
				and honour of the Mosque, and was forbidden. This was the
				particular occasion to which the verse refers. The
				general deduction is clear. A house of Allah is a place
				of sincere devotion, not a theatre for vulgar rites nor a
				source of worldly income. Only sincere Believers have a
				right of entry. Who the sincere Believers are, is

				Hunain is on the road to Taif from Makkah about fourteen
				miles to the east of Makkah. It is a valley in the
				mountainous country between Makkah and Taif. Immediately
				after the conquest of Makkah, (A.H. 8), the Pagan
				idolaters, who were surprised and chagrined at the
				wonderful reception which Islam was receiving, organised
				a great gathering near Taif to concert plans for
				attacking the Prophet. The Hawazin and the Thaqif tribes
				took the lead and prepared a great expedition for Makkah,
				boasting of their strength and military skill. There was
				on the other hand a wave of confident enthusiasm among
				the Muslims at Makkah, in which the new Muslims joined.
				The enemy forces numbered about 4,000 but the Muslim

				laid an ambush in which the advance guard of the Muslim
				forces was caught. The country is hilly, in which the
				enemy concealed himself. As soon as the Muslim vanguard
				entered the Hunain valley, the enemy fell upon them with
				fury and caused havoc with their arrows from their places
				of concealment. In such ground the numbers of the Muslims
				were themselves a disadvantage. Many were slain, and many
				turned back in confusion and retreat. But the Prophet, as

				Jizya: the root meaning is compensation. The derived

				not interfere with the preaching and progress of Islam.
				Imam Shafi'i suggests one dinar per year, which would be
				the Arabian gold dinar of the Muslim States. The tax
				varied in amount, and there were exemptions for the poor,
				for females and children (according to Abu Hanifa), for

				This and the following verse must be read together. They
				condemn the arbitrary and selfish conduct of the Pagan
				Arabs, who, because there was a long-established custom
				of observing four months as those in which fighting was
				forbidden, changed the months about or added or deducted
				months when it suited them, to get an unfair advantage
				over the enemy. The four Prohibited Months were:
				Zul-qa'dah, Zul- hijjah, Muharram, and Rajab. If it
				suited them they postponed one of these months, and so a
				prohibited month became an ordinary month: while their
				opponents might hesitate to fight, they got an undue
				advantage. It also upset the security of the Month of
				Pilgrimage. This very ancient usage made for fair dealing
				all round, and its infraction by the Pagans is condemned.
				The question of a solar astronomical year as against the
				lunar Islamic year does not arise here. But it may be
				noted that the Arab year was roughly luni solar like the
				Hindu year, the months being lunar and the intercalation
				of a month every three years brought the year nearly but
				not accurately up to the solar reckoning. From the year
				of the Farewell Pilgrimage (A.H.10) the Islamic year was
				definitely fixed as a purely lunar year of roughly 354
				days, the months being calculated by the actual
				appearance of the moon. After that, every month of the
				Islamic year came about 11 days earlier in the solar
				year, and thus the Islamic months travelled all round the
				seasons and the solar year.

				mean Reading or in the special sense, the Qur-an. The
				duty of Allah's Messenger is to deliver Allah's Message

			<note id="1478">
				Allah in His infinite Mercy points out the contumacy of
				Sin as a warning, and the exceptional case of Nineveth
				and its Prophet Jonah is alluded to. The story of Jonah
				is told in xxxvii. 139-148, which would be an appropriate
				place for further comments. Here it is sufficient to note
				that Nineveth was a very ancient town which is now no
				longer on the map. Its site is believed to be marked by
				the two mounds on the left bank of the Tigris, opposite
				the flourishing city of Mosul on the right bank, about
				230 miles north-north-west of Bagdad. One of the mounds
				bears the name of "the Tomb of Nabi Yunus." Archeologists
				have not yet fully explored its antiquities. But it is
				clear that it was a very old Sumerian town, perhaps older
				than 3500 B.C. It became the capital of Assyria. The
				first Assyrian Empire under Shalmaneser I, about 1300
				B.C., became the supreme power in Western Asia. Babylon,
				whose tributary Assyria had formerly been, now became
				tributary to Assyria. The second Assyrian Empire arose
				about 745 B.C., and Sennacherib (705-681 B.C.) beautified
				the town with many Public Works. It was destroyed by the
				Scythians (so-called Medes) in 612 B.C. If the date of
				Jonah were assumed to be about 800 B.C., it would be
				between the First and the Second Assyrian Empire; when
				the City was nearly destroyed for its sins, but on
				account of its repentance was given a new lease of
				glorious life in the Second Empire.
			</note>
			<note id="1479">
				The point of the allusion here may be thus explained.
				Nineveh was a great and glorious City. But it became,
				like Babylon, a city of sin. Allah sent the prophet Yunus
				(Jonah) to warn it. Full of iniquities though it was, it
				listened to the warning, perhaps in the person of a few
				just men. For their sakes, the All-Merciful Allah spared
				it, and gave it a new lease of glorious life. According
				to the chronology in the last note the new lease would be
				for about two centuries, after which it perished
				completely for its sins and abominations. Note that its
				new lease of life was for its collective life as a City,
				the life of the Present, i.e., of this World. It does not
				mean that individual sinners escaped the spiritual
				consequences of their sin, unless they individually
				repented and obtained Allah's mercy and forgiveness.

			If it had been the Lord's Will they would all have believed all

			<note id="1480">
				If it had been Allah's Plan or Will not to grant the
				limited Free-will that He has granted to man, His
				omnipotence could have made all mankind alike: all would
				then have had Faith, but that Faith would have reflected
				no merit on them. In the actual world as it is, man has
				been endowed with various faculties and capacities, so
				that he should strive and explore, and bring himself into
				harmony with Allah's Will. Hence Faith becomes a moral
				achievement, and to resist Faith becomes a sin. As a
				complementary proposition, men of Faith must not be
				impatient or angry if they have to contend against
				Unfaith, and most important of all, they must guard
				against the temptation of forcing Faith, i.e., imposing
				it on others by physical compulsion. Forced faith is no

			<note id="1539">
				Let us get a little idea of the geography of the place.
				The letters J.B. and K are philologically
				interchangeable, and Judi, Gudi, Kudi are sounds that can
				pass into each other. There is no doubt that the name is
				connected with the name "Kurd", in which the letter r is
				a later interpolation, for the oldest Sumerian records
				name a people called Kuti or Gutu as holding the middle
				Tigris region not later than 2000 B.C. (see E.B.,
				Kurdistan). That region comprises the modern Turkish
				district of Bohtan, in which Jabal Judi is situated (near
				the frontiers of modern Turkey, modern 'lraq, and modern
				Syria), and the town of Jazirat ibn 'Umar, (on the
				present Turco-Syrian frontier), and it extends into 'Iraq
				and Persia. The great mountain mass of the Ararat plateau
				dominates this district. This mountain system "is unique
				in the Old World in containing great sheets of water that
				are bitter lakes without outlets, Lake Van and Lake
				Urumiya being the chief," (E.B., Asia). Such would be the
				very region for a stupendous Deluge if the usual scanty
				rainfall were to be changed into a very heavy downpour. A
				glacier damming of Lake Van in the Ice Age would have
				produced the same result. The region has many local
				traditions connected with Noah and the Flood. The
				Biblical legend of Mount Ararat being the resting place
				of Noah's Ark is hardly plausible, seeing that the
				highest peak of Ararat is over 16,000 feet high. If it
				means one of the lower-peaks of the Ararat system, it
				agrees with the Muslim tradition about Mount Judi (or
				Gudi), and this is in accordance with the oldest and best
				local traditions. These traditions are accepted by
				Josephus, by the Nestorian Christians, and indeed by all
				the Eastern Christians and Jews, and they are the best in
				touch with local traditions. See (Viscount) J. Bryce,
				"Transcaucasia and Ararat," 4th ed., 1896. p. 216.

				The story of Salih and the Thamud people has been told
				from another point of view in vii. 73-79. The difference
				in the point of view there and here is the same as in the
				story of Hud: see n. 1545 to xi. 50. Note how the story
				now is the same, and yet new points and details are
				brought out to illustrate each new argument. Note, also,
				how the besetting sin of the 'Ad-pride and obstinacy-is
				distinguished from the besetting sin of the Thamud-the
				oppression of the poor, as illustrated by the test case
				and symbol of the She-camel: see n. 1044 to vii, 73. All
				sin is in a sense pride and rebellion; yet sins take
				particular hues in different circumstances, and these
				colours are brought out as in a most artistically painted
				picture-with the greatest economy of words and the most

				According to the sequence of Sura vii, the next reference
				should be to the story of Lut, and that story commences
				at xi. 77 below, but it is introduced by a brief
				reference to an episode in the life of his uncle Abraham,
				from whose seed sprang the peoples to whom Moses, Jesus,
				and Muhammad Al-Mustafa were sent with the major
				Revelations. Abraham had by this time passed through the
				fire of persecutions in the Mesopotamian valleys: he had
				left behind him the ancestral idolatry of Ur of the
				Chaldees; he had been tried and he had triumphed over the
				persecution of Nimrud: he had now taken up his residence
				in Canaan, from which his newphew Lot (Lut) was called to
				preach to the wicked Cities of the Plain east of the Dead
				sea which is itself called Bahr Lut. Thus prepared and
				sanctified, he was now ready to receive the Message that
				he was chosen to be the progenitor of a great line of
				Prophets, and that Message is now referred to. Can we
				localise Nimrud? If local tradition in place-names can be
				relied upon, this king must have ruled over the tract
				which includes the modern Nimrud, on the Tigris, about
				twenty miles south of Mosul. This is the site of Assyrian
				ruins of great interest, but the rise of Assyria as an
				Empire was of course much later than the time of Abraham.
				The Assyrian city was called Kalakh (or Calah), and
				archaeological excavations carried out there have yielded
				valuable results, which are however irrelevant for our
				Commentary. A) Abraham received the strangers with a
				salutation of Peace, and immediately placed before them a
				sumptuous meal of roasted calf. The strangers were
				embarrassed. They were angels and did not eat. If
				hospitality is refused, it means that those who refuse it
				meditate no good to the would be host. Abraham therefore
				had a feeling of mistrust and fear in his mind, which the
				strangers at once set at rest by saying that their
				mission was in the first place to help Lut as a warner to
				the Cities of Plain. But in the second place they had
				good news for Abraham; he was to be the father of great
				peoples!

				Ahadith might be stories, things imagined or related,

				are dreamt of in your philosophy." External events have
				their own limited reality, but there are bigger realities
				behind them, that sometimes appear darkly in the visions
				of ordinary men, but more clearly in the visions of
				poets, seers, sages and prophets. Joseph had to be
				trained in seeing the realities behind events and
				visions. He was hated by his brothers and sold by them
				into slavery; they were sending him into the land of
				Egypt, where he was to rule men. He loved his father
				dearly and was separated from him, and his mother had
				died early; but his affection was not blunted, but drawn
				to a keener edge when his benevolent work benefited
				millions in Egypt, and in the world. His own visions of
				stars, sun, and moon prostrating themselves before him,
				was no idle dream of a selfish fool, but the
				prefigurement of a power, which, used rightly, was to
				make his own honour an instrument of service to millions
				he had not seen, through men and women whose own power
				and dignity were sanctified through him. He was to
				understand the hidden meaning of what seemed futilities,
				blunderings, snares, evil-plottings, love gone wrong, and

				Her speech is subtle, and shows that any repentance or
				compunction she may have felt is blotted out by the
				collective crowd mentality into which she has
				deliberately invited herself to fall. Her speech falls
				into two parts, with a hiatus between, which I have
				marked by the punctuation mark ( ... ). In the first part
				there is a note of triumph, as much as to say, "Now you
				see! mine was no vulgar passion! you are just as
				susceptible! you would have done the same thing!" Finding
				encouragement from their passion and their
				fellow-feeling, she openly avows as a woman amongst women
				what she would have been ashamed to acknowledge to others
				before. She falls a step lower and boasts of it. A step
				lower still, and she sneers at Joseph's innocence, his
				firmness in saving himself guiltless! There is a pause.
				The tide of passion rises still higher, and the dreadful
				second part of her speech begins. It is a sort of joint
				consultation, though she speaks in monologue. The women
				all agree that no man has a right to resist their
				solicitations. Beauty spurned is the highest crime. And
				so now she rises to the height of tragic guilt and
				threatens Joseph. She forgets all her finer feelings, and
				is overpowered by brute passion. After all, he is a slave
				and must obey his mistress! Or, there is prison, and the
				company of the vilest. Poor, deluded, fallen creature!

				When Joseph's character was completely vindicated, there
				was no disgrace to him in being sent to prison after
				that. On the contrary the blame now would attach to those
				who for their own selfish motives restricted his liberty
				for a time. As a matter of fact various motives on the
				part of the many actors in this drama converged towards
				that end. For Joseph prison was better than the
				importunities of the women, and now, not one woman, but
				all society women were after him. To the women themselves
				it looked as if that was a lever which they could use to
				force his compliance. Vain, deluded creatures, to think
				that a man of God could be forced from the path of
				rectitude by threats or bribes. To the 'Aziz it appears
				as if it might be in his wife's best interests that he
				should disappear from her view in prison. The decisive
				factor was the view of the men generally, who were
				alarmed at the consternation he had caused among the
				women. They knew that Joseph was righteous: they had seen
				the Signs of Allah in his wonderful personality and his
				calm and confident fortitude. But, it was argued, it was
				better that one man (even if righteous) should suffer in
				prison rather than that many should suffer from the
				extraordinary disturbance he was unwittingly causing in
				their social life. Not for the first nor for the last
				time did the righteous suffer plausibly for the guilt of
				the guilty. And so Joseph went to prison-for a time.

				Years pass; the times of prosperity go by: famine holds
				the land in its grip; and it extends to neighbouring

				reserves are ample to meet the calamity. Not only does
				Egypt bless him, but neighbouring countries send to Egypt
				to purchase corn. All are received with hospitality, and
				corn is sold to them according to judicious measure. Now
				there has been one sorrow gnawing at Joseph's heart. His

				did, at the loss of his beloved Joseph! And Joseph's
				little brother Benjamin, born of the same mother as
				himself; would the other ten brothers, not by the same
				mother, have any affection for him, or would they treat
				him, as they treated Joseph? How would the whole family
				be in these hard times? A sort of answer came when the
				ten selfish brothers, driven by famine, came from Canaan
				to buy corn. Joseph, though so great a man, kept the
				details of the famine department in his own hands,
				otherwise there might have been waste. But to the public
				he was a mighty Egyptian administrator, probably in
				Egyptian dress, and with all the paraphernalia of his
				rank about him. When his brothers came, he knew them, but
				they did not know he was Joseph. In their thoughts was
				probably some menial slave in a remote household, perhaps

				The Commentators refer to a Jewish or Eastern custom or

				apart from East or West, or custom or superstition, it
				would be ridiculous for any large family of ten or eleven
				to parade together in a procession among strangers. But
				there was even a better reason in this particular case,
				which made Jacob's advice sound, and Jacob was, as stated
				in the next verse, a man of knowledge and experience.
				Here were eleven strangers dressed alike, in a dress not
				of the country, talking a strange language, coming in a
				time of stress, on an errand for which they had no
				credentials. Would they not attract undue attention and
				suspicion if they went together? Would they not be taken
				for spies?-or for men bent on some mischief, theft, or
				organised crime? Such a suspicion is referred to in verse
				73 below. By entering separately they would attract
				little attention. Jacob very wisely tells them to take
				all human precautions. But like a Prophet of Allah he
				warns them that human precautions would be no good if
				they neglect or run counter to far weightier
				matters-Allah's Will and Law. Above all, they must try to
				understand and obey this, and their trust should be on
				Allah rather than on human usages, institutions, or
				precautions, however good and reasonable these might be.

			And when they entered in the manner their father had enjoined it

				See the last verse and n. 1730. Though they scrupulously

				aspersions on Joseph, not knowing that they were in
				Joseph's power. And Joseph took a noble revenge by
				planning a reunion of the whole family and shaming the
				ten brothers into repentance. He was the instrument for

			<note id="1732">
				It is a necessity of a Prophet's soul that he should
				speak out and teach all that he knows, to the worthy and

				for him as Prophet to guarantee any results. In this case
				he could not save his sons from getting into trouble
				merely because they followed the letter of his advice in
				a small matter. Apply this to the teaching of a greater
				than Jacob. Men who literally observe some small
				injunctions of the Holy Prophet Muhammad and neglect the
				greater principles which he taught cannot blame him for
				their troubles and difficulties. If they examined the
				matter, they would find that they brought the troubles on

				their jealousy. Judging by their own standards, they

				had had such opportunities-sitting at the High Table and
				staying with the Wazir. They felt very self-righteous at

				Supposing he had stolen, here would be a fine opportunity
				of getting rid of him. What about their solemn oath to

				come and see for himself.

				This was their family custom. It was of course long
				anterior to the Mosaic Law, which laid down full
				restitution for theft, and if the culprit had nothing, he
				was to be sold for his theft (Exod. xxii. 3). But here
				the crime was more than theft. It was theft, lying, and
				the grossest abuse of confidence and hospitality. While
				the ten felt a secret satisfaction in suggesting the
				penalty, they were unconsciously carrying out Joseph's
				plan. Thus the vilest motives often help in carrying out
				the most beneficent plans.

				brothers, being the fourth son, after Reuben, Simeon, and

				The goodly tree is known for: (1) its beauty; it gives

				as beautiful as it is true. It abides in all the changes
				and chances of this life, and even beyond (see verse 27
				below); it is never shaken by sorrow or what seems to us
				calamity; its roots are deep down in the bed-rock facts
				of life. Its reach is universal, above, around, below: it
				is illuminated by the divine light from heaven, and its
				consolation reaches countless beings of all grades of
				life. Its fruit-the enjoyment of its blessings-is not

				word has no self-pride; he attributes all its goodness,

				Cf. xvi. 26. The wicked plot against Prophets of Allah in

				overwhelmed by some dreadful calamity; xi. 36-38, xxix.
				39-40. The case of Pharaoh is also in point. He was

				to the Makkans during the eight years of the Prophet's
				exile. The conquest of Makkah was bloodless, because the
				power of the enemy had gradually vanished. The Prophet
				was thus able to show the unexampled generosity and

				life. His patience and self-restraint were under
				circumstances of extraordinary provocation. In his human
				wisdom it may sometimes have seemed questionable whether
				forbearance and self-restraint might not be human
				weaknesses; he had to defend his people as well as
				himself against the enemy's persecutions. He is told here
				that he need not entertain any such fears. Patience (with
				constancy) in those circumstances was in accordance with
				Allah's own command. Nor was he to grieve if they

				586 B.C.; rebuilt under Ezra and Nehemiah about 515 B.C.;

				the world in which they had previously lived. They had no
				idea of the duration of time. But when one of them went
				to the town to purchase provisions, he found that the
				whole world had changed. The Christian religion, instead
				of being persecuted was fashionable: in fact it was now
				the State religion. His dress and speech, and the money
				which he brought, seemed to belong to another world. This
				attracted attention. The great ones of the land visited
				the Cave, and verified the tale by questioning the man's
				Companions. When the story became very popular and
				circulated throughout the Roman Empire, we may well
				suppose that an Inscription was put up at the mouth of
				the Cave. See verse 9 and n. 2336. This inscription was
				probably to be seen for many years afterwards, as Ephesus
				was a famous city on the west coast of Asia Minor, about
				forty to fifty miles south of Smyrna. Later on, the
				Khalifa Wathiq (842-846 A.D.) sent an expedition to
				examine and identify the locality, as he did about the
				Zul-Qarnain barrier in Central Asia. A popular story
				circulating from mouth to mouth would necessarily be
				vague as to dates and vary very much in details.
				Somewhere about the 6th century A.D. a Syriac writer
				reduced it to writing. He suggested that the youths were
				seven in number; that they went to sleep in the reign of
				the Emperor Decius (who reigned from 249 to 251 A.D., and
				who was a violent persecutor of Christianity); and that
				they awoke in the reign of Theodosius 11, who reigned
				from 408 to 450 A.D. In our literature Decius is known as
				Daqyanus (from the adjectival Latin from Decianus), and
				the name stands as a symbol of injustice and oppression,
				and also of things old fashioned and out-of-date, as res
				Decianae must have been two or three centuries after
				Decius.

			So they stayed in their Cave three hundred years and (some) add

			<note id="2365">
				This verse should be read with the next verse. In the
				floating oral tradition the duration of time in the Cave
				was given differently in different versions. When the
				tradition was reduced to writing, some Christian writers
				(e.g., Simeon Metaphrastes) named 372 years, some less.
				In round numbers 300 years in the solar Calendar would
				amount to 309 in the lunar Calendar. But the next verse
				points out that all these are mere conjectures: the
				number is known to Allah alone. The authority on which
				Gibbon relies mentions two definite reigns, that of
				Decius (249-251 A.D.) and that of Theodosius 11 (408-450
				A.D.). Taking 250 and 450, we get an interval of 200
				years. But the point of the story does not lie in the
				name of any given Emperor, but in the fact that the
				beginning of the period coincided with an Emperor who
				persecuted: the Emperor's name at the end of the period
				may be taken as approximately correct, because the story
				was recorded within two generations afterwards. One of
				the worst Emperors to persecute the Christians was Nero
				who reigned from 54 to 68. If we took the end of his
				reign (A.D. 68) as the initial point, and (say) 440 A.D.
				as the final point, we get the 372 years of Simeon
				Metaphrastes. But none of these writers knew any more
				than we do. Our best course is to follow the Quranic
				injunction, "Say, Allah knows best how long they stayed"
				(xviii. 26). There is also a rebuke implied: 'do not
				imitate these men who love mischievous controversies!'

				This episode in the story of Moses is meant to illustrate

				the present day, in the sciences and the arts, and in
				literature, (if it could be supposed to be gathered in
				one individual), does not include all knowledge. Divine
				knowledge, as far as man is concerned, is unlimited. Even
				after Moses received his divine mission, his knowledge
				was not so perfect that it could not receive further
				additions. (2) Constant effort is necessary to keep our
				knowledge square with the march of time, and such effort
				Moses is shown to be making. (3) The mysterious man he
				meets (xviii. 65 and n. 2411), to whom Tradition assigns
				the name of Khidhr (literally, Green), is the type of
				that knowledge which is ever in contact with life as it
				is actually lived. (4) There are paradoxes in life;
				apparent loss may be real gain; apparent cruelty may be
				real mercy; returning good for evil may really be justice
				and not generosity (xviii. 79-82). Allah's wisdom
				transcends all human calculation.

			They ask thee concerning Zul-qarnain.  Say "I will rehearse to

			<note id="2428">
				Literally, "the Two-horned one", the King with the Two
				Horns, or the Lord of the Two Epochs. Who was he? In what
				age, and where did he live? The Qur-an gives us no
				material on which we can base a positive answer. Nor is
				it necessary to find an answer, as the story is treated
				as a Parable. Popular opinion identifies Zul-qarnain with
				Alexander the Great. An alternative suggestion is an
				ancient Persian king, or a pre-historic Himyarite King.
				Zul-qarnain was a most powerful king, but it was Allah,
				Who, in His universal Plan, gave him power and provided
				him with the ways and means for his great work. His sway
				extended over East and West, and over people of diverse
				civilisations. He was just and righteous, not selfish or
				grasping. He protected the weak and punished the unlawful
				and the turbulent. Three of his expeditions are described
				in the text, each embodying a great ethical idea involved
				in the possession of kingship or power.

			<note id="2430">
				This is the first of the three episodes here mentioned,
				his expedition to the west. "Reaching the setting of the

				thing. West and East are relative terms. It means a
				western expedition terminated by a "spring of murky
				water." This has puzzled Commentators, and they have
				understood this to mean the dark, tempestuous sea. If
				Zul-qarnain is Alexander the Great, the reference is
				easily understood to be to Lychnitis (now Ochrida), west
				of Macedonia. It is fed entirely by underground springs
				in a limestone region, where the water is never very

				He had great power and a great opportunity. He got

				going to be severe with them and chastise them, or was he
				going to seek peace at any price, i.e., to wink at
				violence and injustice so long as it did not affect his
				power? He chose the better course, as described in the
				next verse. To protect the weak and the innocent, he
				punished the guilty and the headstrong, but he remembered
				always that the true Punishment would come in the
				Hereafter-the true and final justice before the throne of
				Allah.

				Though most powerful among kings, he remembered that his

				were but tentative, to preserve the balance of this life

				He never said like Pharaoh, "I am your Lord Most High!"
				(lxxix. 24). On the contrary his punishments were humbly

				the good he could do to those who lived normal lives in
				faith and righteousness. His rule was easy to them: he
				imposed no heavy tasks because of his power, but gave
				every opportunity to rich and poor for the exercise of
				virtue and goodness. Such is the spiritual lesson to be

			<note id="2439">
				What we are mainly concerned with is its interpretation.
				The Conqueror had now arrived among a people who were
				different in speech and race from him, but not quite
				primitive, for they were skilled in the working of
				metals, and could furnish blocks (or bricks) of iron,
				melt metals with bellows or blow-pipes, and prepare
				molten lead (xviii. 96). Apparently they were a peaceable
				and industrious race, much subject to incursions from
				wild tribes who are called Gog and Magog. Against these
				tribes they were willing to purchase immunity by paying
				the Conqueror tribute in return for protection. The
				permanent protection they wanted was the closing of a
				mountain gap through which the incursions were made.

		<ayah num="95">

			<note id="2440">
				Zul-qarnain was not greedy and did not want to impose a
				tribute to be carried away from an industrious
				population. He understood the power which Allah had given
				him, to involve duties and responsibilities on his
				part-the duty of protecting his subjects without imposing
				too heavy a taxation on them. He would provide the motive
				force and organising skill. Would they obey him and
				provide the material and labour, so that they could close
				the gap with a strong barrier, probably with well-secured
				gates? The word radm, translated "Barrier," does not
				necessarily mean a wall, but rather suggests a blocked
				door or entrance.

				Zakariya was a prophet of the Most High Allah. His office

				correct. Nor are we justified in interpreting verse 57
				here as meaning the same thing as in Gen. v. 24 ("God
				took him"), that he was taken up without passing through
				the portals of death. All we are told is that he was a
				man of truth and sincerity, and a prophet, and that he
				had a high position among his people. It is this point
				which brings him in the series of men just mentioned; he
				kept himself in touch with his people, and was honoured

				used to expose what was wrong in it and to advance the

				responsible for suggesting the making of the golden calf,
				but they could not on that account disclaim
				responsibility for themselves: the burden of the sin is
				on him who commits it, and he cannot pretend that he was

				became sacred, and his throwing it into the calf made the
				calf utter a lowing sound! As if that was the point at

				The cast effigy was destroyed. Thus ends the Samiri's

				above. It may be interesting to pursue the
				transformations of the word Samiri in later times. For
				its origin see notes 2605 and 2608 above. Whether the
				root of Samiri was originally Egyptian or Hebrew does not
				affect the later history. Four facts may be noted. (1)
				There was a man bearing a name of that kind at the time
				of Moses, and he led a revolt against Moses and was
				cursed by Moses. (2) In the time of King Omri (903-896
				B.C.) of the northern kingdom of Israel, there was a man
				called Shemer, from whom, according to the Bible, was
				bought a hill on which was built the new capital of the
				kingdom, the town of Samaria. (3) The name of the hill
				was Shomer (= watchman, vigilant guardian), and that form
				of the name also appears as the name of a man (see II
				Kings xii. 21); some authorities think the town was
				called after the hill and not after the man (Hastings's
				Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics), but this is for
				our present purposes immaterial. (4) There was and is a
				dissenting community of Israelites called Samaritans, who
				have their own separate Pentateuch and Targum, who claim
				to be the true Children of Israel, and who hold the
				Orthodox Jews in contempt as the latter hold them in
				contempt; they claim to be the true guardians (Shomerim)
				of the Law, and that is probably the true origin of the
				name Samaritan, which may go further back in time than
				the foundation of the town of Samaria. I think it
				probable that the schism originated from the time of
				Moses, and that the curse of Moses on the Samiri explains
				the position.

				Note the three kinds of fear mentioned in xxi. 48-49.
				Taqwa is the fear of running counter to the will of

				who entertains it may be found, in his inmost thoughts,
				to be short of the standard which Allah wishes for him;
				this is also righteous but in a less high degree than
				Taqwa which is akin to love. And thirdly, there is the
				fear of consequences on the Day of Judgment (ishfaq);
				this also may lead to righteousness, but is on a still

				father: the problem was how a righteous man should deal
				with his father, when his duty to his father conflicts
				with his duty to Allah. Here the problem is: how a
				righteous man should deal with evil and overcome it; how
				he should fight against evil, and if he is subjected to
				the fire of persecution, how his firmness draws Allah's

				Can we form any idea of the place where he passed through
				the furnace, and the stage in his career at which this
				happened? He was born in Ur of the Chaldees, a place on
				the lower reaches of the Euphrates, not a hundred miles
				from the Persian Gulf. This was the cradle, or one of the
				cradles, of human civilisation. Astronomy was studied
				here in very ancient times, and the worship of the sun,
				moon, and stars was the prevailing form of religion.
				Abraham revolted against this quite early in life, and
				his argument is referred to in vi. 74-82. They also had
				idols in their temples, probably idols representing
				heavenly bodies and celestial winged creatures. He was
				still a youth (xxi. 60) when he broke the idols. This was
				stage No. 2. After this he was marked down as a rebel and
				persecuted. Perhaps some years passed before the incident
				of his being thrown into the Fire (xxi. 68-69) took
				place. Traditionally the Fire incident is referred to a
				king called Nimrud, about whom see n. 1565 to xi. 69. If
				Nimrud's capital was in Assyria, near Nineveh (site near
				modern Mosul), we may suppose either that the king's rule
				extended over the whole of Mesopotamia, or that Abraham
				wandered north through Babylonia to Assyria. Various
				stratagems were devised to get rid of him (xxi. 70), but
				he was saved by the mercy of Allah. The final break came
				when he was probably a man of mature age and could speak
				to his father with some authority. This incident is
				referred to in xix. 41-48. He now left his ancestral
				lands, and avoiding the Syrian desert, came to the
				fertile lands of Aram or Syria, and so south to Canaan,
				when the incident of xi. 69-76 took place. It is some
				years after this that we may suppose he built the Ka'ba
				with Isma'il (ii, 124-29), and his prayer in xiv. 35-41
				may be referred to the same time. His visit to Egypt
				(Gen. xii. 10) is not referred to in the Qur-an.

				The sheep, on account of the negligence of the shepherd,
				got into a cultivated field (or vineyard) by night and
				ate up the young plants or their tender shoots, causing
				damage, to the extent of perhaps a whole year's crop.
				David was king, and in his seat of judgment he considered
				the matter so serious that he awarded the owner of the
				field the sheep themselves in compensation for his
				damage. The Roman law of the Twelve Tables might have
				approved of this decision, and on the same principle was
				built up the Deodand doctrine of English Law, now
				obsolete. His son Solomon, a mere boy of eleven, thought
				of a better decision, where the penalty would better fit
				the offence. The loss was the loss of the fruits or
				produce of the field of vineyard: the corpus of the
				property was not lost. Solomon's suggestion was that the
				owner of the field or vineyard should not take the sheep
				altogether but only detain them long enough to recoup his
				actual damage, from the milk, wool, and possibly young of
				the sheep, and then retum the sheep to the shepherd.
				David's merit was that he accepted the suggestion, even
				though it came from a little boy: Solomon's merit was
				that he distinguished between corpus and income, and
				though a boy, was not ashamed to put his case before his
				father. But in either case it was Allah Who inspired the
				true realisation of justice. He was present and witnessed

				Job (Ayub) was a prosperous man, with faith in Allah,
				living somewhere in the north-east comer of Arabia. He
				suffers from a number of calamities: his cattle are
				destroyed, his servants slain by the sword, and his
				family crushed under his roof. But he holds fast to his
				faith in Allah. As a further calamity he is covered with
				loathsome sores from head to foot. He loses his peace of
				mind, and he curses the day he was born. His false
				friends come and attribute his afflictions to sin. These
				"Job's comforters" are no comforters at all, and he
				further loses his balance of mind, but Allah recalls to
				him all His mercies, and he resumes his humility and
				gives up self-justification. He is restored to
				prosperity, with twice as much as he had before; his
				brethren and friends come back to him; he had a new
				family of seven sons and three fair daughters. He lived
				to a good old age, and saw four generations of

				of this Book comes nearest to Arabic. The account given
				in the Biblical sources and the image that it projects of
				Prophet Job is decidedly different from that found in the
				Qur-an and the Hadith, which present him as a prophet and
				brilliant example of dignified patience becoming of a
				great Prophet of Allah ever trustful in Him and His

				Zul-kifl would literally mean "possessor of, or giving, a
				double requital or portion"; or else, "one who used a
				cloak of double thickness," that being one of the
				meanings of Kifl. The Commentators differ in opinion as
				to who is meant, why the title is applied to him, and the
				point of his being grouped with Isma'il and Idris for
				constancy and patience. I think the best suggestion is
				that afforded by Karsten Niebuhr in his Reisebeschreibung
				nach Arabian, Copenhagen, 1778, ii. 264-266, as quoted in
				the Encyclopaedia of Islam under "Dhul-Kifl". He visited
				Meshad 'All in 'Iraq, and also the little town called
				Kefil, midway between Najaf and Hilla (Babylon). Kefil,
				he says, is the Arabic form of Ezekiel. The shrine of
				Ezekiel was there, and the Jews came to it on pilgrimage.
				If we accept "Zul-kifl" to be not an epithet, but an
				Arabicised form of "Ezekiel", it fits the context.
				Ezekiel was a prophet in Israel who was carried away to
				Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar after his second attack on
				Jerusalem (about B.C. 599). His Book is included in the
				English Bible (Old Testament). He was chained and bound,
				and put into prison, and for a time he was dumb (Ezekiel,
				iii. 25-26). He bore all with patience and constancy, and
				continued to reprove boldly the evils in Israel. In a
				burning passage he denounces false leaders in words which
				are eternally true: "Woe be to the shepherds of Israel
				that do feed themselves! Should not the shepherds feed
				the flocks? Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the
				wool, ye kill them that are fed: but ye feed not the
				flock. The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither
				have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound
				up that which was broken ...... etc. (Ezekiel, xxxiv.
				2-4). Zul-kifl is again mentioned in xxxviii. 48 along
				with Isma'il and Elisha.

				Zun-nun. "the man of the Fish or the Whale", is the title

				98. His story is told in xxxvii. 139-149. When his first
				warning was unheeded by the people, he denounced Allah's
				wrath on them. But they repented and Allah forgave them
				for the time being. Jonah, meanwhile, departed in wrath,
				discouraged at the apparent failure of his mission. He
				should have remained in the most discouraging
				circumstances, and relied on the power of Allah; for
				Allah had power both over Nineveh and over the Messenger
				He had sent to Nineveh. He went away to the sea and took
				a ship, but apparently the sailors threw him out as a man
				of bad omen in a storm. He was swallowed by a big Fish
				(or Whale), but in the depth of the darkness, he cried to

				extreme distress in the situation which he had brought on

				See xix. 2-15, and iii. 38-41. Zakariya was a priest;
				both he and his wife were devout and punctilious in their
				duties. They were old, and they had no son. He was
				troubled in mind, not so much by the vulgar desire to
				have a son to carry on his line, but because he felt that
				his people were not unselfishly devout, and there would
				be no sincere work for Allah unless he could train up
				someone himself. He was given a son Yahya (John the
				Baptist), who added to the devout reputation of the
				family, for he is called "noble, chaste, and a prophet,"
				(iii. 39). All three, father, mother, and son, were made
				worthy of each other, and they repelled evil by their
				devout emulation in virtue.

				mother of John the Baptist; and by implication his also,

				offering of our hearts, and as a symbol of such offer,

				power over the brute creation, and permitted us to eat
				meat, but only if we pronounce His name at the solemn act
				of taking life, for without this solemn invocation, we
				are apt to forget the sacredness of fife. By the
				invocation we are reminded that wanton cruelty is not in
				our thoughts, but only the need of food. Now if we
				further deny the greater part of the food (some
				theologians fix the proportion at three-quarters or
				two-thirds) for the sake of our poorer brethren in solemn
				assembly in the precincts of the Haram (sacred
				territory), our symbolic act finds practical expression
				in benevolence, and that is the virtue sought to be
				taught. We should be grateful to Allah for His guidance
				in this matter, in which many Peoples have gone wrong,
				and we should proclaim the true doctrine so that virtue
				and charity may increase among men.

				In this beautiful passage, Allah's creative work, as far
				as man is concerned, is recapitulated, in order to show
				man's real position in this life, and the certainty of
				the future: to which he was referred for his reward in
				verses 10-11 above. For the various stages of creation,
				see n. 120 to ii. 117. Here we are not concerned with the
				earliest stage, the creation of primeval matter out of
				nothing. It is also a process of creation when inorganic
				matter becomes living matter. Thus inorganic constituents
				of the earth are absorbed into fiving matter by way of
				food and living matter reproduces itself by means of
				sperm. This is deposited in the ovum and fertilises it
				and rests for a time in security in the mother's womb.
				The first change in the fertilised ovum is the conversion
				into a sort of clot of thickly congealed blood; the
				zygote cells grow by segmentation; then the mass
				gradually assumes shape in its growth as a foetus. From
				the lump develop bones and flesh and organs and a nervous
				system. So far man's growth is like that of an animal,
				but a further process takes place which makes the infant
				animal into the infant man. This is the breathing from
				Allah's spirit into him (xv. 29). It may be a continuous
				process parallel to that of physical growth. The child is
				born; it grows; it decays and dies; but after death
				another chapter opens for the individual, and it is to
				remind us of this most momentous chapter that the
				previous stages are recapitulated.

			And We send down water from the sky according to (due) measure

			<note id="2878">
				Normally the rain comes well distributed; it soaks into
				the soil; the moisture is retained for a long time in all
				high grounds; it soaks and penetrates through many layers
				of soil and forms the architecture of physical geography;
				the retentive powers of higher soil enable rivers to flow
				perennially even where, as in India, the rainfall is
				seasonal and confined to a few months in the year.
				Another form in which water comes down from the sky
				according to due measure is in snow and hail: these also
				have their place in the economy of air and soil. Were it
				not for snow and glaciers in the higher mountain regions,
				some of the rivers would fail in their abundant flow. As
				wonderful as the supply of water and moisture is its
				drainage. It retums to the sea and air in all sorts of
				ways, and the formation of mist and clouds repeats the
				cycle. Were it not for the drainage and the clearance of
				the waters, we should have floods and waterlogging, as
				happens when the normal processes of nature are
				temporarily obstructed. The same thing happens when the
				rain comes down in other than due measure. These abnormal
				conditions also have their value. But how grateful should
				man be for Allah's gifts in the ceaseless processes of

				can be readmitted to be a competent witness. The verse

				acquitted of the guilt. If she does not take this step,

				in her tent, having gone to search for a valuable
				necklace she had dropped. As her litter was veiled, it
				was not noticed that she was not in it, until the army
				reached the next halt. Meanwhile, finding the camp had
				gone, she sat down to rest, hoping that some one would
				come back to fetch her when her absence was noticed. It
				was night, and she fell asleep. Next morning she was
				found by Safwan, a Muhajir, who had been left behind the
				camp expressly to pick up anything inadvertently left
				behind. He put her on his camel and brought her, leading
				the camel on foot. This gave occasion to enemies to raise
				a malicious scandal. The ringleader among them was the
				chief of Madinah Hypocrites, 'Abudllah ibn Ubai, who is
				referred to in the last clause of this verse. He had
				other sins and enormities to his debit, and he was left
				to the punishment of an unrepentant sinner, for he died
				in that state. The minor tools were given the legal
				punishment of the law, and after penitence mended their
				lives. They made good.

			</note>
			<note id="2997">
				The physical light is but a reflection of the true Light
				in the world of Reality, and that true Light is Allah. We
				can only think of Allah in terms of our phenomenal
				experience, and in the phenomenal world, light is the
				purest thing we know, but physical light has drawbacks
				incidental to its physical nature: eg. (1) it is
				dependent upon some source external to itself; (2) it is
				a passing phenomenon; if we take it to be a form of
				motion or energy it is unstable, like all physical
				phenomena; (3) it is dependent on space and time; its
				speed is 186,000 miles per second, and there are stars
				whose light takes thousands of years before it reaches
				the earth. The perfect Light of Allah is free from any
				such defects.
			</note>
			<note id="2998">
				The first three points in the Parable center round the
				symbols of the Niche, the Lamp, and the Glass. (1) The
				Niche (Mishkat) is the little shallow recess in the wall
				of an Eastern house, fairly high from the ground, in
				which a light (before the days of electricity) was
				usually placed. Its height enabled it to diffuse the
				light in the room and minimised the shadows. The
				background of the wall and the sides of the niche helped
				to throw the light well into the room, and if the wall
				was white-washed, it also acted as a reflector: the
				opening in front made the way for the light. So with the
				spiritual Light; it is placed high, above worldly things;
				it has a niche or habitation of its own, in Revelation
				and other Signs of Allah; its access to men is by a
				special Way, open to all, yet closed to those who refuse
				its rays. (2) The Lamp is the core of the spiritual
				Truth, which is the real illumination; the Niche is
				nothing without it; the Niche is actually made for it.
				(3) The Glass is the transparent medium through which the
				Light passes. On the one hand, it protects the light from
				moths and other forms of low life and from gusts of wind,
				and on the other, it transmits the fight through a medium
				which is made up of and akin to the grosser substances of
				the earth (such as sand, soda, potash, etc.), so arranged
				as to admit the subtle to the gross by its transparency.
				So the spiritual Truth has to be filtered through human
				language or human intelligence to make it intelligible to
				mankind.
			</note>
			<note id="2999">
				The glass by itself does not shine. But when the light
				comes into it, it shines like a brilliant star. So men of
				God, who preach Allah's Truth, are themselves illuminated
				by Allah's light and become the illuminating media
				through which that Light spreads and permeates human
				life.

				The olive tree is not a very impressive tree in its

				ingredient of food. The fruit has a specially fine
				flavour. Cf. n. 2880 to xxiii. 20. For the illuminating
				quality of its oil, see n. 3002 below.

				This Olive is not localised. It is neither of the East
				nor of the West. It is universal, for such is Allah's
				Light. As applied to the olive, there is also a more
				literal meaning, which can be allegorised in a different
				way. An olive tree with an eastern aspect gets only the
				rays of the morning sun; one with a western aspect, only
				the rays of the western sun. In the northern hemisphere
				the south aspect will give the sun's rays a great part of
				the day, while a north aspect will shut them out
				altogether, and vice versa in the southern hemisphere.
				But a tree in the open plain or on a hill will get
				perpetual sunshine by day; it will be more mature, and
				the fruit and oil will be of superior quality. So Allah's
				light is not localised or immature: it is perfect and
				universal.

			<note id="3052">
				Tabaraka: the root meaning is "increase" or "abundance".
				Here that aspect of Allah's dealing with His creatures is
				emphasised, which shows His abundant goodness to all His
				creatures, in that He sent the Revelation of His Will,
				not only in the unlimited Book of Nature, but in a
				definite Book in human language, which gives clear
				directions and admonitions to all. The English word
				"blessed" hardly conveys that meaning, but I can find no
				other without departing far from established usage. To
				emphasise the meaning I have explained, I have translated
				"Blessed is..." but "Blessed be..." is also admissible,
				as it brings out another shade of meaning, that we praise

				the Righteous and the sufferings of the Evil, were

			</note>
			<note id="3099">
				In our artificial life and surroundings we fail to see

				praise, and rightly, the wonderful colors of sunset. We
				see, particularly in climates more northerly than that of
				India, the subtle play of Light and Shade in the
				twilights succeeding sunsets. If we were as assiduous in
				seeing sunrises and the play of Light and Shade preceding
				them, we should see phenomena even more impressive, as
				the early moming seems to us more holy than any other
				time in the twenty-four hours of the sun's daily journey.
				There is first the false dawn, with its curious uncertain
				light and the curious long uncertain shadows which it
				casts. Then there are the streaks of black in the East,
				succeeded by the true dawn, with its delicate tones of
				colours and light and shade. The light of this true or
				false Dawn is not given by the direct rays of the sun. In
				a sense it is not light, but the shadows or reflections
				of light. And they gradually merge into actual sunrise,
				with its more substantial or more defined shadows, which
				we can definitely connect with the sun.

				Cf. vii. 57. The Winds are heralds of Joy, ushering in

				physical fact which all can see. But water is also the
				symbol of spiritual life, whose sustaining principle is
				the Will of Allah as made known to us through Revelation.
				It sometimes comes to us in our inward or spiritual
				storms. Many violent unsettlements of the spirit are but

			<note id="3111">
				Maraja: literally, let free or let loose cattle for
				grazing. Bahrain: two seas, or two bodies of flowing
				water; for bahr is applied both to the salt sea and to
				rivers. In the world taken as a whole, there are two
				bodies of water, viz.,: (1) the great salt Ocean, and (2)
				the bodies of sweet water fed by rain, whether they are
				rivers, lakes or underground springs: their source in
				rain makes them one, and their drainage, whether
				above-ground or underground, eventually to the Ocean,
				also makes them one. They are free to mingle, and in a
				sense they do mingle, for there is a regular water-cycle:
				see n. 3106 above: and the rivers flow constantly to the
				sea, and tidal rivers get sea-water for several miles up
				their estuaries at high tide. Yet in spite of all this,
				the laws of gravitation are like a barrier or partition
				set by Allah, by which the two bodies of water as a whole
				are always kept apart and distinct. In the case of rivers
				carrying large quantities of water to the sea, like the
				Mississippi or the Yangtse-Kiang, the river-water with
				its silt remains distinct from sea-water for a long
				distance out at sea. But the wonderful Sign is that the

				remain distinct bodies, with their distinct functions.

			<note id="3112">
				In Allah's overall scheme of things, bodies of salt and

				wisdom. Incidentally, this verse points to a fact which
				has only recently been discovered by science. This fact
				relates to the oceans of the world: they meet and yet

				Having shown clearly the distinction between the False
				and the True, Abraham now shows in the formn of a Prayer
				what his inmost wishes are. (1) He wants his own soul
				entightened with divine wisdom, and (2) his heart and
				life filled with righteousness; (3) he will not be
				content with working for himself or his own generation:
				his view extends to all future generations; (4) and of
				course he wishes to attain the goal of the righteous, the
				Garden of the Bliss of the Divine Countenance; but he is
				not content with this; for (5) he wants his father and

				The ancient religion of the people of Saba (the Himyar or

				easy access to Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf by way of
				the sea, as well as with Abyssinia. That accounts for the

				Governor Abraha and his discomfiture in the year of the
				Prophet's birth (S.cv.), say 570 A.D. Jewish-Christian
				influences were powerful in Arabia in the sixth century

				against any enemy of their country. But their queen is

			And he entered the City at a time when its people were not

				That may have been either the time of the noontime
				siesta, when all business is suspended even now in Egypt,
				or the time of night, when people are usually asleep. The
				latter is more probable, in view of verse 18 below. But
				there is also another suggestion. A guest in a Palace is
				not free to wander about at will in the plebeian quarters
				of the City at all sorts of hours, and this applies even
				more to an inmate of the Palace brought up as a son.
				Moses was therefore visiting the City privately and
				eluding the guards. His object may have been to see for
				himself how things were going on; perhaps he had heard
				that his people were being oppressed, as we may suppose
				that he had retained contact with his mother.

			<note id="3342">
				His object was apparently to strike him so as to release
				the Israelite, not to kill the Egyptian, In fact he
				killed the Egyptian. This was unfortunate in more ways
				than one. His visit to the City was clandestine; he had
				taken the side of the weaker and despised party; and he
				had taken the life of an Egyptian. He was full of regrets
				and repentance, and he prayed to Allah, and obtained
				Allah's forgiveness.

			<note id="3344">

				was friendly to him, as explained below. We may suppose
				that after the first day's fight, there had been a great
				deal of talk in the bazars, both among Israelites and
				Egyptians. Probably the Israelites were elated at finding
				a champion-perhaps more elated than they should have
				been, and in a provocative mood, which deserved Moses's
				rebuke. Probably the Egyptians had discussed who this new
				champion was, and had already apprised the Palace, to
				which Moses had not dared to retum.

			<note id="3346">

				after crossing the Isthmus, plunge into the Sinai desert,

			And when he arrived at the watering (place) in Madyan he found

				The first thing that a wanderer in a desert would make
				for would be an oasis where he could get water from a

				was probably a deep well, as surface springs are rare in
				sandy deserts, where the water level is low, unless there
				was a hill from which issued a spring.
			</note>
			<note id="3351">
				Here is a pretty little idyll, told in the fewest and
				most beautiful words possible. Moses arrives at an oasis
				in the desert, weary and travel worn, with his mind full
				of anxiety and uncertainty owing to his recent
				experiences in Egypt. He was thirsty and would naturally
				seek water. At the well or spring he found shepherds (or
				perhaps goat-herds) watering their flocks. As a stranger
				it was not for him to thrust himself among them. He
				waited under the shade of a tree until they should
				finish. He noticed two damsels, also waiting with their
				flocks, which they had come to water. His chivalry was
				roused. He went at once among the goat-herds, made a
				place for the flocks of the damsels, gave them water, and
				then resumed his place in the shade. They were modest
				maidens, and had given him in three Arabic words the key
				of the whole situation. 'Abu- na shaikhun Kabirun our
				father is a very old man, and therefore cannot come to
				water the flocks; we therefore do the work; we could not
				very well thrust ourselves among these men.'
			</note>
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="24">
			So he watered (their flocks) for them; then he turned back to the
			shade and said: "O my Lord! truly am I in (desperate) need of any
			good that thou dost send me!"... <fn>3352</fn>
			<note id="3352">
				The maidens are gone, with smiles on their lips and
				gratitude in their hearts. What were the reflections of
				Moses as he returned to the shade of the tree? He
				returned thanks to Allah for the bright little vision
				which he had just seen. Had he done a good deed? Precious
				was the opportunity he had had. He had slaked his thirst.
				But he was a homeless wanderer and had a longing in his
				soul, which he dared not put into words. Those shepherds
				were no company for him. He was truly like a beggar in
				desperate need. For any little good that came his way, he
				was grateful. But what was this?-this vision of a
				comfortable household, presided over by an old man rich
				in flocks and herds, and richer still in two daughters,
				as modest as they were beautiful? Perhaps he would never
				see them again! But Allah was preparing another surprise
				for him.
			</note>
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="25">
			Afterwards one of the (damsels) came (back) to him walking
			bashfully. She said: "My father invites thee that he may reward
			thee for having watered (our flocks) for us." So when he came to
			him and narrated the story he said: "Fear thou not: (well) hast
			thou escaped from unjust people." <fn>3353</fn> <fn>3354</fn>
			<note id="3353">
				Scarcely had he rested, when one of the damsels came
				back, walking with bashful grace! Modestly she gave her

				least give some return for your kindness.'
			</note>
			<note id="3354">
				Nothing could have been more welcome than such a message,
				and through such a messenger. Moses went of course, and
				saw the old man. He found such a well-ordered patriarchal
				household. The old man was happy in his daughters and
				they in him. There was mutual confidence. They had
				evidently described the stranger to him in terms which
				made his welcome a foregone conclusion. On the other hand
				Moses had allowed his imagination to paint the father in
				something of the glorious colours in which his daughters
				had appeared to him like an angelic vision. The two men
				got to be friends at once. Moses told the old man his
				story,-who he was, how he was brought up, and what
				misfortunes had made him quit Egypt. Perhaps the whole
				household, including the daughters, listened breathlessly
				to his tale. Perhaps their wonder and admiration were
				mingled with a certain amount of pity-perhaps with some
				more tender feeling in the case of the girl who had been
				to fetch him. In any case the stranger had won his place
				in their hearts. The old man, the head of the household,
				assured him of hospitality and safety under his roof. As
				one with a long experience of life he congratulated him
				on his escape. 'Who would live among unjust people? It is
				as well you are free of them!'

			<note id="3357">
				A little time passed, and at length the father broached
				the subject of marriage. It was not for the fugitive to
				suggest a permanent tie, especially when, in the wealth
				of this world, the girl's family was superior, and they
				had an established position, while he was a mere
				wanderer. The father asked if he would marry one of the
				daughters and stay with them for at least eight years, or
				if he liked, ten years, but the longer term was at his
				option. If he brought no dower, his service for that
				period was more than sufficient in lieu of dower. The
				particular girl intended was no doubt tacitly settled
				long before, by the mutual attraction of the young hearts
				themselves. Moses was glad of the proposal, and accepted
				it. They ratified it in the most solemn manner, by
				appealing to Allah. The old man, knowing the worth of his
				son-in-law, solemnly assured him that in any event he
				would not take advantage of his position to be a hard
				task-master or to insist on anything inconsistent with
				Moses's interests, should a new future open out to him.
				And a new and glorious future was awaiting him after his
				apprenticeship.

			<note id="3358">
				In patriarchal society it was not uncommon to have a
				marriage bargain of this kind conditional on a certain
				term of service. In this case the episode conveys two
				lessons. (1) A man destined to be a messenger of Allah is
				yet a man, and must pass through the ups and downs of
				life like any other man: only he will do it with more
				grace and distinction than other men. (2) The beautiful
				relations in love and marriage may themselves be a
				preparation for the highest spiritual destiny that may
				await a Messenger of Allah. A woman need not necessarily
				be a snare and a temptation: she may be the understanding
				help-mate that the Lady Khadija was to the holy Prophet.

				Allah, Our own merits are so small that they should never

			The parable of those who take protectors other than Allah is that
			of the Spider who builds (to itself) a house; but truly the
			flimsiest of houses is the Spider's house if they but knew.
			<fn>3466</fn> <fn>3467</fn>
			<note id="3466">
				The Spider's house is one of the wonderful Signs of
				Allah's creation. It is made up of fine silk threads spun
				out of silk glands in the spider's body. There are many
				kinds of spiders and many kinds of spider's houses. Two
				main types of houses may be mentioned. There is the
				tubular nest or web, a silk-lined house or burrow with
				one or two trap-doors. This may be called his residential
				or family mansion. Then there is what is ordinarily
				called a spider's web, consisting of a central point with
				radiating threads running in all directions and acting as
				tie-beams to the quasi-circular concentric threads that
				form the body of the web. This is his hunting box. The
				whole structure exemplifies economy in time, material,
				and strength. If an insect is caught in the net, the
				vibration set up in the radiating threads is at once
				communicated to the spider, who can come and kill his
				prey. In case the prey is powerful, the spider is
				furnished with poison glands with which to kill his prey.
				The spider sits either in the centre of the web or hides
				on the under-side of a leaf or in some crevice, but he
				always has a single thread connecting him with his web,
				to keep him in telephonic communication. The female
				spider is much bigger than the male, and in Arabic the
				generic gender of 'Ankabut is feminine.
			</note>
			<note id="3467">
				Most of the facts in the last note can be read into the
				Parable. For their thickness the spider's threads are
				very strong from the point of view of relativity, but in
				our actual world they are flimsy, especially the threads
				of the gossamer spider floating in the air. So is the
				house and strength of the man who relies on material
				resources however fine or beautiful relatively; before
				the eternal Reality they are as nothing. The spider's
				most cunning architecture cannot stand against a wave of
				a man's hand. His poison glands are like the hidden
				poison in our beautiful worldly plans which may take
				various shapes but have seeds of death in them.

				into our inmost life and being, for then we realize the

				The sincere Jews and Christians found in the holy Prophet
				a fulfillment of their own religion. For the names of
				some Jews who recognized and embraced Islam, see n. 3227
				to xxvi. 197. Among the Christians, too, the Faith slowly
				won ground. Embassies were sent by the holy Prophet in
				the 6th and 7th years of the Hijrat to all the principal
				countries round Arabia, viz., the capital of the
				Byzantine Empire (Constantinople), the capital of the
				Persian Empire (Madain), the Sasanian capital known to
				the West by the Greek name of Ctesiphon, (about thirty
				miles south of modern Bagdad), Syria, Abyssinia, and
				Egypt. All these (except Persia) were Christian
				countries. In the same connection an embassy was also
				sent to Yamama in Arabia itself (east of the Hijaz) where
				the Banu Hanifa tribe was Christian, like the Harith
				tribe of Najran who voluntarily sent an embassy to
				Madinah. All these countries except Abyssinia eventually
				became Muslim, and Abyssinia itself has a considerable
				Muslim population now and sent some Muslim converts to
				Madinah in the time of the Prophet himself. As a
				generalization it is true that the Jewish and the
				Christian peoples as they existed in the seventh century
				of the Christian era have been mainly absorbed by Islam,
				as well as the lands in which they predominated. Remnants
				of them built up new nuclei. The Roman Catholic Church
				conquered new lands among the northern (Germanic) Pagans
				and the Byzantine Church among the eastern (Slavonic)
				Pagans, and the Protestantism of the 16th century gave a

				must hearken (xxx. 23). (5) Next, we must approach the
				higher reaches of spiritual hopes and fears, as

				and electricity, which may kill the foolish or bring

				This Sura relates to Wisdom, and the Qur-an is
				appropriately called the Wise Book, or the Book of
				Wisdom. In verse 12 below there is a reference to Luqman
				the Wise. "Wise" in this sense (Hakim) means not only a
				man versed in knowledge human and divine, but one
				carrying out in practical conduct ('amal) the right
				course in life to the utmost of his power. His knowledge
				is correct and practical, but not necessarily complete:
				for no man is perfect. Such an ideal involves the
				conception of a man of heroic action as well as of deep
				and workman-like knowledge of nature and human
				nature,-not merely dreams or speculation. That ideal was
				fulfilled in a most remarkable degree in the holy
				Prophet, and in the sacred Book which was revealed
				through him. "The Wise Book" (Kilab-ul-hakim) is one of
				the titles of the Qur-an.

				came and invested Madinah and failed utterly. It

				Central Arabia, the Jews previously expelled for
				treachery from Madinah, the Jews remaining in Madinah and
				the Hypocrites led by Abdullah ibn Ubi, who have already
				been described in ix. 43-110. Their bond of union was the
				common hatred of Islam, and it snapped under the reverses
				they met with. It is important to note three points. (1)
				The Jews as a body now lost their last chance of bearing
				the standard of Islam: the best of them had already
				accepted the renewal of Allah's Message. (2) A definite
				status was given to Prophet's household, after the

				Madinah, which is about 3,000 ft. above the sea-level.
				The enemy's tents were torn up, their fires were
				extinguished, the sand and rain beat in their faces, and
				they were terrified by the portents against them. They
				had already well nigh fallen out amongst themselves, and
				beating a hasty retreat, they melted away. The Madinah
				fighting strength was no more than 3,000, and the Jewish

				elsewhere. Its capital, Khaibar, is about 90 miles due
				north of Madinah. Its inhabitants offered some
				resistance, and Hadhrat 'Ali, though he had just risen
				from a bed of illness, performed prodigies of valour.
				After its surrender, a land settlement was made, which

			<note id="3706">
				We now come to the subject of the position of the
				Consorts of Purity (azwaj mutahharat), the wives of the
				holy Prophet. Their position was not like that of
				ordinary women or ordinary wives. They had special duties
				and responsibilities. The only youthful marriage of the
				holy Prophet was his first marriage-that with Hadhrat
				Khadija, the best of women and the best of wives. He
				married her fifteen years before he received his call to
				Prophethood; their married life lasted for twenty-five
				years, and their mutual devotion was of the noblest,
				judged by spiritual as well as social standards. During
				her life he had no other wife, which was unusual for a
				man of his standing among his people. When she died, his
				age was 50, and but for two considerations, he would
				probably never have married again, as he was most
				abstemious in his physical life. The two considerations
				which governed his later marriages were: (1) compassion
				and clemency, as when he wanted to provide for suffering
				widows, who could not be provided for in any other way in
				that stage of society; some of them, like Sauda, had
				issue by their former marriage, requiring protection; (2)
				help in his duties of leadership, with women, who had to
				be instructed and kept together in the large Muslim
				family, where women and men had similar social rights.
				Hadhrat Aisha, daughter of Hadhrat Abu Bakr, was clever
				and learned, and in Hadith she is an important authority
				on the life of the Prophet. Hadhrat Zainab, daughter of
				Khuzaima, was specially devoted to the poor; she was
				called the "Mother of the Poor". The other Zainab,
				daughter of Jahsh, also worked for the poor, for whom she
				provided from the proceeds of her manual work, as she was
				skillful in leather work. But all the Consorts in their
				high position had to work and assist as Mothers of the
				Ummat. Theirs were not idle lives, like those of
				Odalisques, either for their own pleasure or the pleasure
				of their husband. They are told here that they had no
				place in the sacred Household if they merely wished for
				ease or worldly glitter. If such were the case, they
				could be divorced and amply provided for.

			And as one who invites to Allah's (Grace) by His leave and as a
			Lamp spreading Light. <fn>3735</fn>
			<note id="3735">
				See last note. The two other capacities in which the
				Prophet was sent are here specified. (4) He comes as one
				who has a right to invite all men to repentance and the
				forgiveness of sins: but he does this, not of his own
				authority, but by the permission and authority given to
				him by Allah. This is said lest people may deify the
				Prophet as they did with other Prophets before him. The
				personal responsibility of each individual remains, but
				the Prophet can lead him on the Right and help him. (5)
				The Prophet also comes as a Light or a Lamp (Siraj) to
				illuminate the whole world. In lxxi. 16 and elsewhere the
				same word (Siraj) is used for the sun. The comparison is
				apt. When the sun appears, all the lesser lights pale
				before its light. And the Message of Islam, i.e., of the
				Universal Religion, is to diffuse Light everywhere.

				This introduces no new exemption or privilege. Verses
				50-52 merely declare the points in which, on account of
				the special circumstances (see n. 3706 above), the
				Prophet's marriages differed from those of ordinary
				Muslims. This is considered under four heads, which we
				shall examine in the four notes following.
			</note>
			<note id="3742">
				Head 1. Marriage with dower (iv. 4): this is the
				universal Muslim marriage. The difference in the
				Prophet's case was that there was no limitation to the
				number of four (iv. 3), and women of the People of the
				Book (v. 6) were not among his wives, but only Believers.
				These points are not expressly mentioned here, but are
				inferred by his actual practice. Obviously women who are
				expected to instruct other women in Islam must be
				Muslims.
			</note>
			<note id="3743">
				Head 2. Women Prisoners of War: the same remark as in the
				last note.
			</note>
			<note id="3744">
				Head 3. These are first cousins, and not within the
				Prohibited Degrees of Marriage (see iv. 23-24). These are
				specially mentioned here by way of limitation. None of
				them could marry the Prophet unless she had performed the
				Hijrat with him.
			</note>
			<note id="3745">
				Head 4. A believing woman who gives herself to the
				Prophet: obviously this case, like the last, is only
				applicable to the Prophet, and it is hedged round with
				the limitation that the Prophet considers it suitable.
			</note>
			<note id="3746">
				The ordinary law of Muslim marriage will be found chiefly
				in ii. 221-235, iv. 19-25, iv. 34-35, and v. 6.
			</note>
			<note id="3747">

				In iv. 3 it is laid down that more than one wife is not
				permissible "if ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal
				justly with them". In a Muslim household there is no room
				for a "favourite wife" in the sense that such a wife is
				recipient of favours denied to other wives. In the
				special circumstances of the Prophet there were more than
				one, and he usually observed the rule of equality with
				them, in other things as well as in the rotation of
				conjugal rights. But considering that his marriages after
				he was invested with the Prophetic office were mainly
				dictated by other than conjugal or personal
				considerations (see n. 3706. xxxiii. 28), the rotation
				could not always be observed, though he observed it as
				much as possible. This verse absolves him from absolute
				adherence to a fixed rotation. There are other
				interpretations, but I agree with most of the
				Commentators in the view I have explained.
			</note>
			<note id="3750">
				Where the rotation was for some reason interfered with,
				it was permissible, by another interference with the
				usual rotation, to bring satisfaction to one who had been
				previously set aside. This was not only permitted, but
				commended, as tending to remove dissatisfaction and cheer
				and comfort the eyes and hearts of those who were
				disappointed in their turn.
			</note>
			<note id="3751">
				Cooling the eyes: an Arabic idiom for cheering and
				comforting eyes which yearn to see those they love. A
				verse of Zeb-un-nisaa, daughter of the Mugal Emperor
				Aurangzeb, may be rendered thus: "My heart is glad
				whenever lover-wise I dwell upon thy beauties and thy
				grace! But how can I content my hungry eyes, That ask
				continually to see thy face?"
			</note>
			<note id="3752">
				There was not much in the way of worldly goods or
				satisfaction that the Prophet could give them: see
				xxxiii. 28 above. But he was kind, just, and true;-the
				best of men to his family, and they all clung to him.

				Our human hearts, however good on the whole, may yet, in
				their motives, have possibly some baser admixture. The
				feminine hearts are not more immune in this respect than
				the masculine. But everything is known and understood by
				Allah, Who will in His mercy make all allowance for our
				human weaknesses. His title of "Most Forbearing" (Halim)
				also gives His devoted worshippers the cue: why should we
				not also forbear with the faults and weaknesses of our
				neighbours and fellow-creatures?

				The rules of refined social ethics is as necessary to
				teach to-day as it was with the rude Arabs whom the holy
				Prophet had to teach in his day. Those mentioned in this
				verse may be briefly recapitulated thus: (1) Enter not a
				friend's house without permission; (2) if invited to
				dine, don't go too early; you are asked to dine, not to
				wait for the preparation of the food; (3) be there at the
				time appointed, so that you enter when you are expected
				and invited; (4) after the meal, don't get familiar with
				your host, especially if there is a great distance
				between him and you; (5) don't waste time in
				tittle-tattle, causing inconvenience and perhaps
				annoyance to your host; (6) understand what is proper
				behaviour for you: he may be too polite to ask to depart.
				All this has a social bearng: respect and delicate
				consideration for others are among the highest virtues.
			</note>
			<note id="3756">
				The actual manner of showing respect to ladies may be
				different in different circumstances. But it is an
				essential principle of good society to show the greatest
				deference to them. To the "Mothers of the Believers" this
				respect was due in an exceptional degree.
			</note>
			<note id="3757">
				Considering his position, the holy Prophet deserved to be
				respected before all other men and nothing should be done
				to cause him the least harm and annoyance. This applied
				not only during his life-time, but it applies now,
				because his teaching and personality are alive to us. It
				was not fitting that his widows, both for their own
				position and for the position of the Prophet, should be
				married by other men after him. And this mark of respect
				was duly observed in history.

			<note id="3758">
				"Annoy": Aza (IV) may equally mean: to vex, to cause hurt
				or injury, to insult, to ill-treat by slander or unseemly
				conduct, or hurt the feelings of (some one). The Prophet
				came with a divine mission to teach and reclaim the
				world, and he is entitied to the respect of all, even of
				those who do not consciously acknowledge his mission, for
				his mission works constantly like the forces of nature.
				In a minor degree the "Mothers of the Believers" are also
				entitied to respect.

				Hamala: to undertake, bear, carry (the Trust or
				responsibility), to be equal to it. This is the ordinary
				meaning, and the majority of Commentators construe so.
				But some understand it to mean "to carry away, run away
				with, to embezzle (the thing entrusted); hence to be
				false to the Trust, to betray the Trust." In that case
				the sense of verses 72-73 would be: "Allah offered the
				Trust to other creatures, but they refused, lest they
				should betray it, being afraid from that point of view:
				but man was less fair to himself: in his ignorance he
				accepted and betrayed the Trust, with the result that

				man so high and noble? The differentiating quality which
				Allah gave man was that Allah breathed something of His
				own spirit into man (xxxii. 9; xv. 29 and n. 1968; and
				other passages). This meant that man was given a limited

				as a merchant puts by some of his wealth to invest as

		<ayah num="11">
			Thou canst but admonish: such a one as follows the Message and

			<note id="3951">
				Cf. xxxv. 18. As far as those are concerned, who have
				obstinately delivered themselves to evil, the preaching
				of Allah's Message has no appeal, because their own will
				shuts them out. But there are others who are anxious to
				hear Allah's Message and receive Allah's grace. They love
				Allah and fear to offend against His holy Law, and their
				fear is not merely superficial but deep-seated: for while
				they do not yet see Allah, nor do other people see them,
				they have the same sense of Allah's presence as if they
				saw Him, and their religion is not a mere pose, "to be
				seen of men".
			</note>
			<note id="3952">
				See n. 3902 to xxxv. 18. Unseen is here adverbial: their
				reverence for Allah is unaffected by the fact that they
				do not see Him, or that other people do not observe them,
				because their attitude arises out of a genuine love for
				Allah.
			</note>
			<note id="3953">
				To such persons the Message of Allah comes as a gospel or
				good news: because it shows them the way of forgiveness
				for anything wrong in their past, and it gives them the
				promise of a full reward in the future,-generous beyond
				any deserts of their own, but arising out of Allah's
				unbounded Bounty.

			Set forth to them by way of a parable the (story of) the
			Companions of the City.  Behold there came apostles to it.
			<fn>3957</fn>
			<note id="3957">
				Many of the classical Commentators have supposed that the
				City referred to was Antioch. Now Antioch was one of the
				most important cities in North Syria in the first century
				of the Christian era. It was a Greek city founded by
				Seleucus Nicator, one of the successors of Alexander,
				about 300 B.C. in memory of his father Antiochus. It was
				close to the sea, and had its sea-port at Seleucia. Soon
				after Christ his disciples successfully preached there,
				and they "were called Christians first in Antioch": Acts,
				xi. 26. It afterwards became the seat of a most important
				Bishopric of the Christian Church. In the story told here
				"by way of a parable", the City rejected the Message, and
				the City was destroyed: xxxvi. 29. Following Ibn Kathir,
				I reject the identification with Antioch decisively. No
				name, or period, or place is mentioned in the text. The
				significance of the story is in the lessons to be derived
				from it as a parable, for which see the next note. That
				is independent of name, time, or place.

				Allah sends His messengers or teachers of Truth by ones

				Their mission is divine, but they do not claim to be more

				if it were a reproach, whereas it should commend them to
				men, for mankind is glorified by such commission and by
				Allah's Self-revelation. The Message is clearly expressed
				in human language, but because it exposes all evil, men
				think it unlucky, as it checks their selfishness. It is
				often the poorest and most despised of mankind, from the
				outskirts or "farthest parts of the City", that accept
				the Message and are willing to work and die for it. The

			Lord of the heavens and of the earth and all between them and
			Lord of every point at the rising of the sun! <fn>4034</fn>
			<note id="4034">
				Allah is the Lord of everything that exists-'the heavens
				and the earth, and all between them'. He is the Lord of
				the Mashariq,-of every point at the rising of the sun. As
				the Commentators tell us, there are in the solar year
				only two equinoctial days, when the sun rises due east:
				on every other the sun rises at a shifting point either
				north or south of due east. In vii. 137 we have Mashariq
				al ardhi wa magaribaha, where the plural of the words for
				East and West is negligible, as the conjunction of the
				two embraces all points. The same may be said of lxx. 40,
				where Allah is called "Lord of all points in the East and
				the West". If we are speaking of longitudes, they may
				embrace all latitudes. In lv. 17 Allah is called "Lord of
				the two Easts and the two Wests", referring to the
				extreme points in either case. A cursory reader may ask,
				why is only the East referred to here? The reply is that
				it is not so much the East as the rising of the sun, on
				which stress is laid. The Arabic mashriq or mashariq is
				close enough to the root-word sharaqa, to suggest, not so
				much the East as the rising of the sun, especially when
				the plural form is used. The glorious sun rises from
				different points, as seen by us, but it illuminates the
				whole heaven and earth. It is an emblem of Unity.

				This was in the fertile land of Syria and Palestine. The

				is symbolical. Allah does not require the flesh and blood

				does require the giving of our whole being to Allah, the

			<note id="4101">
				Our version may be compared with the Jewish-Christian
				version of the present Old Testament. The Jewish
				tradition, in order to glorify the younger branch of the
				family, descended from Isaac, ancestor of the Jews, as
				against the elder branch, descended from Isma'il,
				ancestor of the Arabs, refers this sacrifice to Isaac
				(Gen. xxii. 1-18). Now Isaac was born when Abraham was
				100 years old (Gen. xxi. 5), while Isma'il was born to
				Abraham when Abraham was 86 years old (Gen. xvi. 16).
				Isma'il was therefore 14 years older than Isaac. During
				his first 14 years Isma'il was the only son of Abraham;
				at no time was Isaac the only son of Abraham. Yet, in
				speaking of the sacrifice, the Old Testament says (Gen.
				xxii. 2): "And He said, Take now thy son, thine only son
				Issac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of
				Moriah: and offer him there for a burnt offering..." This
				slip shows at any rate which was the older version, and
				how it was overlaid, like the present Jewish records, in
				the interests of a tribal religion. The "land of Moriah"
				is not clear: it was three days' journey from Abraham's
				place (Gen. xxii. 4). There is less warrant for
				identifying it with the hill of Moriah on which Jerusalem
				was afterwards built than with the hill of Marwa which is
				identified with the Arab tradition about Isma'il.

				Ahab (B.C. 896-874) and Ahaziah (B.C. 874-872), kings of
				the (northern) kingdom of Israel or Samaria. He was a
				prophet of the desert, like John the Baptist,-unlike our
				holy Prophet, who took part in, controlled, and guided
				all the affairs of his people. Both Ahab and Azariah were
				prone to lapse into the worship of Baal, the sun-god

				covet more.
			</note>
			<note id="4175">
				Especially, said David, is it wrong for brothers or men

				disappeared as mysteriously as they had come. It was then
				that David realised that the incident had been a trial or
				temptation-a test of his moral or spiritual fibre! Great
				though he was as a king, and just though he was as a
				judge, the moment that he thought of these things in
				self- pride, his merit vanished. In himself he was as
				other men: it was Allah's grace that gave him wisdom and

				washed off from him by his own act of self-realisation
				and repentance. This was freely accepted by Allah, as the

				As stated in n. 1471 above, this vision and its moral are
				nowhere to be found in the Bible. Those who think they
				see a resemblance to the Parable of the prophet Nathan (2
				Samuel, xii. 1-12) have nothing to go upon but the
				mention of the "one ewe" here and the "one little
				ewe-lamb" in Nathan's Parable. The whole story is here
				different, and the whole atmosphere is different. The
				Biblical title given to David, "a man after God's own
				heart" is refuted by the Bible itself in the scandalous
				tale of heinous crimes attributed to David in chapters xi
				and xii. of 2 Samuel, viz., adultery, fraudulent dealing
				with one of his own servants, and the contriving of his
				murder. Further, in chapter xiii, we have the story of
				rapes, incest, and fratricide in David's own household!
				The fact is that passages like those are mere chroniques
				scandaleuses, i.e., narratives of scandalous crimes of
				the grossest character. The Muslim idea of David is that
				of a man just and upright, endowed with all the virtues,
				in whom even the least thought of self-elation has to be
				washed off by repentance and forgiveness.

			<note id="4185">
				The story is not found in the Old Testament. I interpret
				it to mean that, like his father David, Solomon was also
				most meticulous in not allowing the least motive of self
				to be mixed up with his spiritual virtues. He was fond of
				horses; he had great armies and wealth; but he used them
				all in Allah's service. Cf. xxvii. 19. n. 3259; xxvii.
				40. n. 3276, etc. His battles were not fought for lust of
				blood, but as Jihad in the cause of righteousness. His
				love of horses was not like that of a mere race-goer or
				of a warrior: there was a spiritual element in it. He
				loved by a kind of love which was spiritual,-the love of
				the highest Good. Some commentators interpret this verse
				saying that Soloman, peace be upon him, was so engrossed
				in the inspection of his fine horses that he completely
				forgot to say his 'Asr prayer before the sunset'.

				What was the trial of Solomon? All the power, wealth, and

				the power he had-over the jinns, men, and the forces of

			<note id="4189">
				"The body on his throne" has been variously interpreted.

				The mystery of life and death, sleep and dreams, is a
				fascinating enigma, of which the solution is perhaps
				beyond the ken of man. A vast mass of superstition as
				well as imaginative and psychological literature has
				grown up about it. But the simplest and truest religious
				doctrine is laid down here in a few words. In death we
				surrender our physical life, but our soul does not die;
				it goes back to a plane of existence in which it is more
				conscious of the realities of the spiritual world: "Allah
				takes the soul".
			</note>
			<note id="4307">
				Cf. vi. 60. What is sleep? As far as animal life is
				concerned, it is the cessation of the working of the
				nervous system, though other animal functions, such as
				digestion, growth, and the circulation of the blood,
				continue, possibly at a different pace. It is the repose
				of the nervous system, and in this respect it is common
				to man and animals, and perhaps even to plants, if, as is
				probable, plants have a nervous system. The mental
				processes (and certainly volition) are also suspended in
				sleep, except that in ordinary dreams there is a medley
				of recollections, which often present vividly to our
				consciousness things that do not or cannot happen in
				nature as we know it in our coordinated minds. But there
				is another kind of dream which is rarer-one in which the
				dreamer sees things as they actually happen, backwards or
				forwards in time, or in which gifted individuals see
				spiritual truths otherwise imperceptible to them. How can
				we explain this? It is suggested that our soul or
				personality,-that something which is above our animal
				life-is then in a plane of spiritual existence akin to
				physical death (see last note), when we are nearer to
				Allah. In poetic imagery, Sleep is "twin-brother to
				Death".
			</note>
			<note id="4308">
				Sleep being twin-brother to Death, our souls are for the
				time being released from the bondage of the flesh. Allah
				takes them for the time being. If, as some do, we are to
				die peacefully in sleep, our soul does not come back to
				the physical body, and the latter decays and die. If we
				have still some period of life to fulfil according to
				Allah's decree, our soul comes back to the body, and we
				resume our functions in this life.
			</note>
			<note id="4309">
				If we contemplate these things, we can see more clearly
				many spiritual truths: e.g. (1) that our bodily life and
				death are not the whole story of our existence; (2) that
				in our bodily life we may be dead to the spiritual world,
				and in our bodily death, may be our awakening to the
				spiritual world; (3) that our nightly Sleep, besides
				performing the function of rest to our physical life,
				gives us a foretaste of what we call death, which does
				not end our personality; and (4) that the Resurrection is
				not more wonderful than our daily rising from Sleep,
				"twin-brother to Death".

				This is a difficult passage, describing the primal
				creation of our physical earth and the physical heavens
				around us. If we count the two Days mentioned in this

				while in many passages the creation is stated to have
				taken place in six Days: see vii. 54, n. 1031; and xxxii.
				4, n. 3632. The Commentators understand the "four Days"
				in verse 10 to include the two Days in verse 9, so that
				the total for the universe comes to six Days. This is
				reasonable, because the processes described in verses 9
				and 10 form really one series. In the one case it is the
				creation of the formless matter of the earth; in the
				other case it is the gradual evolution of the form of the

				globe are mentioned first; and the making of the sky into
				the seven firmaments is mentioned last. The two
				statements are not inconsistent. It is stated here that
				when the sky was made into seven firmaments, it had
				existed previously as smoke, or vapour, or steam. The
				idea I derive from a collation of the relevant Quranic
				passages is that Allah first created primeval matter,
				which was as yet without order, shape, or symmetry. This
				state is called Chaos as opposed to Cosmos in Greek
				Cosmogony. The next stage would be the condensation of
				this primeval matter, into gases, liquids, or solids: on
				this subject no precise information is given to us: it
				belongs to the realm of Physics. About the earth we are
				told of four stages or Days, and about the heavens, of
				two stages or Days. For Days see n. 4477 below. If these
				stages proceeded or proceed together in time, it is

				the laws laid down for it.

			<note id="4477">
				For "Days", which may include thousands of years, see
				vii. 54, and n. 1031. They refer to stages in the
				evolution of physical nature. In the Biblical cosmogony,
				(Gen. i, and ii. 1-7), which reflects old Babylonian
				cosmogony, the scheme is apparently to be taken literally
				as to days and is as follows. The first day Allah created
				light; the second, the firmament; the third, the earth
				and vegetation; the fourth, the stars and plants; the
				fifth, fish and fowl from the sea; and the sixth, cattle,
				creeping things, beasts on land, and man; on the seventh
				day He ended His work and rested. Our scheme is wholly
				different. (1) Allah did not rest, and never rests. "His
				Throne doth extend over the heavens and the earth, and He
				feeleth no fatigue in guarding and preserving them"; (2)
				Allah's work has not ended; His activity still goes on:
				xxxii. 5; vii, 54; (3) man in our scheme does not come in
				with land animals; his advent is much later; (4) our
				stages are not sharply divided from each other, as in the
				above scheme, where the stars and planets having been
				created on the fourth day, it is not intelligible how the
				first three days were counted, nor how vegetation grew on
				the third day. Our stages for earth and heaven are not in
				sequence of time for the heavens and the earth. Our six
				stages are broadly speaking, (1) the throwing off of our
				planet from cosmic matter; (2) its cooling and
				condensing; (3) and (4) the growth of vegetable and
				animal life; (5) and (6) the parallel growth of the
				starry realm and our solar system.

				Cf. xv. 17, and n. 1951; also xxxvii. 6-9. The transition
				from the third person ("He completed," etc.) to the first

				creation is an impersonal act: the act of adornment and
				guarding is a personal favour to Allah's creatures.

				"Consultation." This is the key-word of the Sura, and

			<note id="4581">
				See last note. When you stand up for rights, either on
				private or public grounds, it may be through processes of
				law, or by way of private defence in so far as the law
				permits private action. But in all cases you must not
				seek a compensation greater than the injury suffered. The
				most you can do is to demand equal redress, i.e., a harm
				equivalent to the harm done to you. Even this may serve
				to curb your unregenerate soul, or a community bent on
				revenge. But the ideal mode is not to slake your thirst
				for vengeance, but to follow better ways leading to the
				reform of the offender or his reconciliation. See xli.
				34, and xxiii. 96. You can take steps to prevent
				repetition, by physical or moral means; the best moral
				means would be to turn hatred into friendship by
				forgiveness and love. In that case the compensation or
				reward (if we must use such terms) is infinitely greater,
				for it wins the good pleasure of Allah. But this active
				righting of wrongs, whether by physical or by moral or
				spiritual means, which are commended as better, is an
				antithesis to the monkish doctrine, when you are smitten
				on one cheek, to turn the other also. This would not
				suppress, but encourage wrong-doing. It is practised by
				none but poltroons, and is preached only by hypocrites,
				or men who want to make slaves of others by depriving
				them of the power of self-defence. It occurs in two of
				the four canonical Gospels (Matt. v. 39, and Luke vi.
				29), but we need not therefore assume that it was
				preached by Jesus.

			Then watch thou for the Day that the sky will bring forth a kind

			<note id="4695">
				What Day is this? It obviously refers to great calamity,
				and from the wording it is to be a great calamity in the

				verse 11 may be compared to gashiya in lxxxviii. 1, which
				obviously refers to the final Day of Judgment. But verse
				15 below ("We shall remove the Penalty for a while")
				shows that it is not the final Judgment referred to here,
				but some calamity that was to happen soon afterwards.
				Perhaps it was a famine, about which see the next note.
			</note>
			<note id="4696">
				The "smoke" or "mist" is interpreted on good authority to
				refer to a severe famine in Makkah, in which men were so
				pinched with hunger that they saw mist before their eyes
				when they looked at the sky. Ibn Kathir in his Tarikh
				mentions two famines in Makkah, one in the 8th year of
				the Mission, say the fourth year before the Hijra, and
				another about the 8th year after the Hijra. But as either
				or both of these famines lasted as many as seven years,
				the dates are to be taken very roughly. It is even
				possible that the two famines were continuous, of varying
				severity from year to year. Bukhari mentions only the
				post-Hijrat famine, which was apparently so severe that
				men began to eat bones and carrion. Abu Sufyan (about 8
				A.H.) approached the holy Prophet to intercede and pray
				for the removal of the famine, as the Pagans attributed
				it to the curse of the Prophet. Sura xxiii., which is
				also Makkan, but of later date than the present Sura,
				also refers to a famine: see xxiii. 75, and n. 2921. As
				Suras were not all revealed entire, but many came
				piecemeal, it is possible that particular verses in a
				given Sura may be of different dates from the Sura as a
				whole.

				Allah gives every chance to all His creatures, however

				personal, perhaps economic, to see if that would bring

				learn. Perhaps, for the latter, he gives them a chance by

				The similitude in the Gospel is about how the good seed
				is sown and grows gradually, even beyond the expectation
				of the sower: "the seed should spring and grow up, he
				knoweth not how; for the earth bringeth forth fruit of
				herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the
				full corn in the ear": Mark. iv. 27-28. Thus Islam was
				preached by the holy Prophet; the seed seemed to human
				eyes lost in the ground; but it put forth its shoot, and
				grew, and became strong, until it was able to stand on
				its own legs, and its worst enemies recognised its
				existence and its right to live. Note how much more

			</note>
			<note id="4918">
				I construe the particle "li" as expressing not the

				own minds, a contrast to the satisfaction, wonder, and
				delight of the Prophet and his Companions. The pronoun in
				"rage at them" of course refers to the Prophet and his

				jugular veins correspond to the two carotid arteries
				which carry the blood from the heart to the head. As the

				True charity remembers not only those in need who ask,

				There may be various reasons which prevent a man from
				asking for help: (1) he may be ashamed to ask, or his
				sense of honour may prevent him from asking; (2) he may
				be so engrossed in some great ideal that he may not think
				of asking; (3) he may even not know that he is in need,
				(4) he may not know that you possess the things that can
				supply his needs; and (5) he may be a dumb and helpless
				creature, whether a human being or a dumb animal, or any
				creature within your ken or power. Charity in the higher

			By the Star when it goes down <fn>5085</fn>

				An-Najm is interpreted in various ways. As most commonly
				accepted, it means either a Star generically, or the
				close cluster of seven stars known as the Pleiades in the
				Constellation Taurus, which the sun enters about the 21st
				of April every year. In mid-April, or a little later, the
				beautiful cluster would set just after the sun, after
				having gradually ascended the sky in the winter months.
				In late May, or a little later, it would rise just before
				the sun. In its western aspects, it might be considered a
				spring constellation. To open-air nations (including the
				Arabs) whose climate usually presents starry skies, this
				is an object of great interest, and many folklore tales
				gather round it. When so glorious a cluster is content to
				bow down in the horizon and merge its light in the
				greater light created by Allah, it becomes a symbol of
				humility in beauty and power before the Most High. Whose
				revelation discloses the summit of beauty, power, and
				wisdom. Hawa in the text may mean either "goes down (or

				like that of a man writing a book. He must form the
				design in his mind; he must prepare himself by research,
				collection of knowledge, or of personal experience; he
				must use or acquire the art of writing; he must collect

				This refers to the Jewish tribe of the Banu Nadhi whose
				intrigues and treachery nearly undid the Muslim cause
				during the perilous days of the battle of Uhud in
				Shawwal, A.H. 3. Four months after, in Rabi, 1. A.H. 4,
				steps were taken against them. They were asked to leave
				the strategic position which they occupied, about three
				miles south of Madinah, endangering the very existence of
				the Ummat in Madinah. At first they demurred, relying on
				their fortresses and on their secret alliance with the
				Pagans of Makkah and the Hypocrites of Madinah. But when
				the Muslim army was gathered to punish them and actually
				besieged them for some days, their allies stirred not a
				finger in their aid, and they were wise enough to leave.
				Most of them joined their brethren in Syria, which they
				were permitted to do, after being disarmed. Some of them
				joined their brethren in Khaibar; see n. 3705 to xxxiii.
				27. The Banu Nadhir richly deserved punishment, but their
				lives were spared, and they were allowed to carry away
				their goods and chattels.

				They had played a double game. Originally they were sworn
				allies of the Madinah Muslims under the holy Prophet, but
				they secretly intrigued with the Makkah Pagans under Abu
				Sufyan and the Madinah Hypocrites. They even tried
				treacherously to take the life of the Prophet while he
				was on a visit to them, breaking both the laws of
				hospitality and their own sworn alliance. They thought
				the Pagan Quraish of Makkah and the Hypocrites of Madinah
				would help them, but they did not help them. On the
				contrary the eleven days siege showed them their own
				helplessness. Their supplies were cut off; the exigencies
				of the siege necessitated the destruction of their
				outlying palm trees; and the unexpected turn in their
				fortunes disheartened them. Their hearts were stack with
				terror and they capitulated. But they laid waste their

				How can a translator reproduce the sublimity and the

				power which enforces law and justice. (2) Human authority
				may be misused, but in the title "the Holy One", we

				replete with the highest Purity. (3) "Salam" has not only
				the idea of Peace as opposed to Conflict, but wholeness
				as opposed to defects: hence our paraphrase "Source of
				Peace and Perfection". (4) Mu-min, one who entertains
				Faith, who gives Faith to others, who is never false to
				the Faith that others place in him: hence our paraphrase
				"Guardian of Faith". (5) "Preserver of Safety"; guarding
				all from danger, corruption, loss, etc.; the word is used

				Under the treaty of Hudaibiya [see Introduction to S.

				the Quraish had already broken the treaty, and some
				instruction was necessary as to what the Madinah Muslims
				should do in those circumstances. Muslim women married to
				Pagan husbands in Makkah were oppressed for their Faith,
				and some of them came to Madinah as refugees. After this,
				they were not to be returned to the custody of their
				Pagan husbands at Makkah, as the marriage of believing
				women with non-Muslims was held to be dissolved if the
				husbands did not accept Islam. But in order to give no
				suspicion to the Pagans that they were badly treated as
				they lost the dower they had given on marriage, that

				Now come directions as to the points on which women
				entering Islam should pledge themselves. Similar points
				apply to men, but here the question is about women, and
				especially such as were likely, in those early days of
				Islam, to come from Pagan society into Muslim society in
				the conditions discussed in notes 5422 and 5423 above. A
				pledge on these points would search out their real
				motives: (1) to worship none but Allah; (2) not to steal;
				(3) not to indulge in sex outside the marriage tie; (4)
				not to commit infanticide; (the Pagan Arabs were prone to
				female infanticide): (5) not to indulge in slander or
				scandal; and (6) generally, to obey loyally the law and
				principles of Islam. The last was a comprehensive and
				sufficient phrase, but it was good to indicate also the
				special points to which attention was to be directed in
				those special circumstances. Obedience was of course to
				be in all things just and reasonable: Islam requires
				strict discipline but not slavishness. A) "That they will
				not utter slander intentionally forging falsehood".
				Literally, "...nor produce any lie that they have devised
				between their hands and feet,". These words mean that
				they should not falsely attribute the paternity of their
				illegitimate children to their lawful husbands thereby
				adding to the monstrosity of their original sin of
				infidelity.

				If pledges are sincerely given for future conduct,
				admission to Islam is open. If there is anything in the

				forgiveness is to be prayed for. Allah forgives in such
				cases: how can man refuse to give such cases a real

				The supreme Achievement has already been mentioned viz.;

				A portion of the Children of Israel-the one that really
				cared for Truth-believed in Jesus and followed his
				guidance. But the greater portion of them were hard
				hearted, and remained in their beaten track of formalism
				and false racial pride. The majority seemed at first to
				have the upper hand when they thought they had crucified
				Jesus and killed his Message. But they were soon brought
				to their senses. Jerusalem was destroyed by Titus in A.D.
				70 and the Jews have been scattered ever since. "The
				Wandering Jew" has become a bye-word in many literatures.
				On the other hand, those who followed Jesus permeated the
				Roman Empire, brought many new races within their circle,
				and through the Roman Empire, Christianity became the
				predominant religion of the world until the advent of
				Islam. So is it promised to the people of Islam: they
				must prevail if they adhere to the Truth. Badr (A.H. 2)
				was a landmark against Pagan Arabia; Qadisiya (A.H. 14)
				and Madain (A.H. 16) against the might of Persia: Yarmuk
				(A.H. 15) against the might of the Byzantine Empire in
				Christian Syria; and Heliopolis (A.H. 19) against the
				same Empire in Christian Egypt and Africa. These were
				symbols in external events. The moral and spiritual
				landmarks are less tangible, and more gradual, but none
				the less real. Mark how the arrogance and power of
				Priesthood have been quelled; how superstition and a
				belief in blind Fate have been checked; how the freedom
				of human individuals has been reconciled with the
				sanctity of marriage in the law of Divorce; how the civil
				position of women has been raised; how temperance and
				sobriety have been identified with religion; what impetus
				has been given to knowledge and experimental science; and
				how economic reconstruction has been pioneered by
				rational schemes for the expenditure and distribution of
				wealth.

				Friday, is primarily the Day of Assembly, the weekly
				meeting of the Congregation, when we show our unity by
				sharing in common public worship, preceded by a Khutba,
				in which the Imam (or Leader) reviews the week's fife of
				the Community and offers advice and exhortation on good
				living. Notice the gradations of social contact for
				Muslims if they followed the wise ordinances of their
				Faith. (1) Each individual remembers Allah for himself or
				herself five or more times every day in the home or place
				of business, or local mosque, or open air, as the case
				may be. (2) On Friday in every week there is a local
				meeting in the central mosque of each local centre,-it
				may be a village, or town, or ward of a big city. (3) At
				the two 'Ids every year, there is a large local area
				meeting in one centre. (4) Once at least in a lifetime,
				where possible, a Muslim shares in the vast international
				assemblage of the world, in the centre of Islam, at the
				Makkan Pilgrimage. A happy combination of
				decentralisation and centralisation, of individual
				liberty and collective meeting, and contact at various

				is easy to carry out. Are we carrying out the more

				consultation, and collective understanding and action?
			</note>
			<note id="5462">
				The idea behind the Muslim weekly "Day of Assembly" is
				different from that behind the Jewish Sabbath (Saturday)
				or the Christian Sunday. The Jewish Sabbath is primarily
				a commemoration of Allah's ending His work and resting on
				the seventh day (Gen. ii. 2; Exod. xx. 11): we are taught
				that Allah needs no rest, nor does He feel fatigue (ii.
				255). The Jewish command forbids work on that day but
				says nothing about worship or prayer (Exod. xx. 10); our
				ordinance lays chief stress on the remembrance of Allah.
				Jewish formalism went so far as to kill the spirit of the
				sabbath, and call forth the protest of Jesus: "the
				sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath"
				(Mark. ii. 27). But the Christian Church, although it has
				changed the day from Saturday to Sunday, has inherited
				the Jewish spirit: witness the Scottish Sabbath; except
				in so far as it has been secularised. Our teaching says:
				'When the time for Jumua Prayer comes, close your
				business and answer the summons loyally and earnestly,
				meet earnestly, pray, consult and learn by social
				contact; when the meeting is over, scatter and go about
				your business'.

				this", says 'Aisha, "I felt jealous, and Hafsa, Sawda,
				Safiya, and I agreed among ourselves that when he visits
				us each of us would tell him that a peculiar odour came
				from his mouth as a result of what he had eaten, for we
				knew that he was particularly sensitive to offensive
				smells". So when his wives hinted at it, he vowed that he
				would never again use honey. Thereupon these verses were
				revealed reminding him that he should not declare to
				himself unlawful that which Allah had made lawful to him.
				The important point to bear in mind is that he was at
				once rectified by revelation, which reinforces the fact
				that the prophets are always under divine protection, and
				even the slightest lapse on their part is never left
				uncorrected.

				not have held the balance even between his private
				feelings and his public duties. But he was not an

				his realisation of the higher duties with which he was

				of selfish obstinacy. (6) If they were to resist frank

				The analysis of sin is given in four master-strokes, of

				indifference. (2) But Conscience and the sense of Right
				will try to prevent the flight; the Grace of Allah will
				meet the sinner at all corners and try to reclaim him;
				the hardened sinner will deliberately turn away his face
				from it, insult it, and reject it. (3) The result of this
				psychology will be that he will abandon himself to greed,
				to the correction of riches, and the acquisition of
				material advantages to which he is not entitied; this may
				involve hypocrisy, fraud, and crime. (4) Having acquired
				the material advantages, the next step will be to keep
				others out of them, to prevent hoarded wealth from
				fructifying by circulation, to conceal it from envy or
				spite. This is the spiritual Rake's Progress.

			We sent Noah to his People (with the Command): "Do thou warn thy
			people before there comes to them a grievous Penalty."
			<fn>5705</fn>
			<note id="5705">
				Noah's mission is referred to in many places. See
				specially xi. 25-49 and notes. His contemporaries had
				completely abandoned the moral law. A purge had to be
				made, and the great Flood made it. This gives a new
				starting point in history for Noah's People,-i.e., for
				the remnant saved in the Ark.

			<note id="5706">
				His Warning was to be both clear (i.e., unambiguous) and
				open (i.e., publicly proclaimed). Both these meanings are
				implied in Mubin. Cf. lxvii. 26. The meaning of the
				Warning was obviously that if they had repented, they

		<ayah num="3">
			"That ye should worship Allah fear Him and obey me: <fn>5707</fn>
			<note id="5707">
				Three aspects of man's duty are emphasized: (1) true
				worship with heart and soul; (2) God-fearing recognition
				that all evil must lead to self-deterioration and
				Judgment; (3) hence repentance and amendment of life, and
				obedience to good men's counsels.

			stated Term: For when the Term given by Allah is accomplished it

			<note id="5708">
				Allah gives respite freely; but it is for Him to give it.
				His command is definite and final; neither man nor any
				other authority can alter or in any way modify it. If we
				could only realise this to the full in our inmost soul,
				it would be best for us and lead to our happiness.

			<fn>5709</fn>
			<note id="5709">
				When convincing arguments and warnings are placed before
				sinners, there are two kinds of reactions. Those who are
				wise receive admonition, repent, and bring forth fruits
				of repentance, i.e., amend their lives and turn to Allah.
				On the other hand, those who are callous to any advice
				take it up as a reproach, fly farther and farther from
				righteousness, and shut out more and more the channels

			<note id="5710">
				The literal meaning would be that, just as they thrust
				their fingers into their ears to prevent the voice of the

				Each of these blessings-rain and crops, wealth and

				joys of heaven. A) I.e., why don't you fear Allah's
				Majesty, His greatness and consequent punishment for your
				sinfulness, and hope for His mercy, kindness and reward

				Fijaj implies valley-roads or passes between mountains.
				Though there are mountain chains on the earth, Allah's

				The Punishment of sin seizes the soul from every side and

				skin, the limbs, the flesh, the brains, the bones, and
				every part of the body. So the destruction wrought by sin
				is complete from all points of view. And yet it is not
				death (xx. 74); for death would be a merciful release
				from the Penalty, and the soul steeped in sin has closed
				the gates of Allah's Mercy on itself. There they will
				abide, unless and "except as Allah willeth" (vi. 128).

			"He (alone) knows the Unseen nor does He make any one acquainted

			<note id="5749">
				The Unseen has two aspects. The relative Unseen is so
				with reference to a particular person, because of the
				intervention of Time, Space, or particular circumstances.
				For example, I cannot see to-day a house which I saw last
				year, because it has since been pulled down. Or I cannot
				in Lahore see the "Gateway of India" in Bombay, although
				any one in Bombay can see it. Or I cannot see the
				satellites of Jupiter with the naked eye, though I can
				through a telescope. But the Absolute Unseen, the
				Absolute Mystery, is something which no creature can know
				or see, except in so far as Allah reveals it to him. And
				Allah reveals such things to the extent that is good for
				men, through His chosen messengers, among whom the
				greatest is Muhammad. The exact time of the Hour of
				Judgment has not been so shown, because we must not wait
				for it, but live as if it is to be at this minute. See

				Revelation is not a mechanical or material thing. It has
				to be safeguarded from being distorted or corrupted by
				ignorance, selfishness, or the powers of evil. How can
				its precious and subtle worth and the spiritual
				safeguards against its misuse by human folly or the
				perversity of evil be expressed in plain human words? We
				can imagine a very great treasure, which has to be
				transmitted. To guard it against evilly-disposed persons,
				a strong escort is required, to march in front and
				behind, so as to protect it from all sides. When it
				reaches its destination, the escort presents its
				credentials and an Invoice showing the Treasure being
				transmitted. Then the destined receiver knows that it has
				come intact and feels satisfied. So about spiritual
				Revelation. The Prophet recognises the credentials and
				checks the contents on the tablets of his own heart and
				insight. He has then no doubt that it is a true Message
				from Allah, and that those who bring it are the true
				messengers "of their Lord". A) They: the band of
				watchers. In "he may know" it is better to construe "he"

				Cf., above, lxxiii. 24. The Prophet, and a zealous band
				of his disciples, were often up, two-thirds of the night,
				or a half, or a third, rejecting sleep and giving
				themselves up to Prayer and Praise and the reading of the
				Qur-an. They are told that this was too severe a tax on
				them, especially if their health was affected, or they
				were on a journey, or they were striving, with might and
				main, in other ways, for the cause of Allah. See die
				fines following.
			</note>
			<note id="5772">
				The usual meaning taken is that the counting of the exact
				hours of night and day may not be possible for ordinary
				people, in order to determine exactly the half, or the
				third, or the two-thirds of a night. The length of the
				night and the day varies every day of the solar year, and
				the precise hour of midnight can only be determined by
				exact observation in clear skies or by chronometers,
				which is not possible for everyone. But I understand it
				in a wider meaning. Allah fixes night and day in due
				proportions; for rest and work, and according to seasonal
				variations. For prayer and praise no meticulous
				observations of that kind are necessary or possible.
				Allah's service can be done in many ways as detailed
				below. But we must give some time to devotion, as may be
				most easy and convenient to us, in various circumstances
				of health, travel, and the performance of various duties.
			</note>
			<note id="5773">
				The reading of the Qur-an here is a part of Prayer and
				religious devotion. This is not to be made into an
				obsession or a burden. Cf. xx. 2: "We have not sent down
				the Qur-an to thee to be an occasion for thy distress."
				We must do it whole-mindedly, but not by formal
				mechanical computations.
			</note>
			<note id="5774">
				This refers to Jihad. The better opinion is that this
				particular verse was revealed in Madinah, long after the

				canonical Prayers and regular Charity (Zakat), points to
				the same conclusion.
			</note>
			<note id="5775">
				Cf. ii. 2456, and n. 276, where the meaning of "a
				Beautiful Loan" is explained. See also lvii. 18. The
				"Beautiful Loan" should be that of our own souls. We
				should expect no retums in kind, for that is not
				possible. But the reward we shall find with Allah will be
				infinitely greater and nobler. Cf. the biblical phrase,
				"Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven" (Matt. vi.
				20).
			</note>
			<note id="5776">
				Any good that we do raises our own spiritual status and
				dignity. We must not think that when we speak of Allah's
				service or Allah's Cause, we are doing anything for His
				benefit: He is independent of all needs whatsoever.
			</note>
			<note id="5777">
				This emphasizes the need of Allah's Grace. Whatever good
				we do, our own merits are comparatively small. Allah's

				In these wonderful early verses there is a double thread

				publicly proclaim the Lord: his heart had always been
				purified, but now all his outward doings must be

				Cf. lxvi. 6, and n. 5540. There was a great volume of
				angelology in the religious literature of the People of
				the Book (i.e., the Jews and Christians) to whom (among
				others) an appeal is made in this verse. The Essenes, a
				Jewish brotherhood with highly spiritual ideas; to which
				perhaps the prophet Jesus himself belonged, had an
				extensive literature of angelology. In the Midrash also,
				which was a Jewish school of exegesis and mystical
				interpretation, there was much said about angels. The
				Eastern Christian sects contemporary with the birth of
				Islam had borrowed and developed many of these ideas, and
				their mystics owed much to the Gnostics and the Persian
				apocalyptic systems. In the New Testament the relation of
				the angels with Fire is referred to more than once. In
				Rev. ix. 11 we have "the angel of the bottomless pit,
				whose naine in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the
				Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon". In Rev. xiv. 18
				there is an "angel which had power over fire", and in
				Rev. xvi. 8 an angel has "power ... given unto him to
				scorch men with fire". In the Old Testament (Daniel vii.
				9-10) the essence of all angels is fire: thousand
				thousands of them issued as a fiery stream from before
				the Ancient of Days, whose "throne was like the fiery
				flame, and His wheels as burning fire".

				The significance of numbers is a favourite theme with
				some writers, but I lay no stress on it. In Christian
				theology the number of the Beast, 666, in Rev. xiii. 18
				has given rise to much controversy, and may refer only to
				the numerical value of the letters in the name of the
				Roman Emperor Nero. In our own literature I think that we
				ought to avoid too much insistence on speculative
				conjectures.

				There are four classes of people mentioned here. (1) The
				Muslims will have their faith increased, because they
				believe that all revelation is from Allah Most Merciful,
				and all His forces will work in their favour. (2) The
				People of the Book, those who had received previous
				revelations of an analogous character, the Jews and
				Christians, had numerous sects disputing with each other
				on minute points of doctrine; but they will now, if they
				believe, find rest from controversies in a broad
				understanding of scripture. (3) Those in whose hearts is
				a disease (see ii. 8-10, notes 33-34), the insincere
				ones, the hypocrites, will only be mystified, because
				they believe nothing and have rejected the grace and

				It is a necessary consequence of moral responsibility and

				warning and instruction-his spiritual forces-are
				infinite, as are His powers. No man can know them. But
				this warning or reminder is addressed to all mankind. All
				things are referred to Allah. But we must not attribute
				evil to Him. In iv. 79 we are expressly told that the
				good comes from Allah, and the evil from ourselves.

			Nay verily: by the Moon <fn>5798</fn>
			<note id="5798">
				An oath in human speech calls in evidence something
				sacred in the heart of man. In Allah's Message, also,
				when delivered in human language, solemn emphasis is
				indicated by an appeal to something striking among the
				Signs of Allah, which will go straight to the human heart
				which is addressed. In each case the symbol of the appeal
				has reference to the particular point enforced in the
				argument. Here we are asked to contemplate three
				wonderful phenomena, and they lead up to the conclusion
				in verse 38. (1) The moon, next after the sun, is the
				most striking luminary to our sight. Its reflected light
				has for us even a greater mystery than the direct light
				of the sun, which looks to us like pure fire. The moon
				was worshipped as a deity in times of darkness. But in
				reality, though she rules the night, her rays are only
				reflections, and are wanting in warmth and vitality. So
				every soul which looks up to a mere creature of Allah for
				a sort of vicarious salvation is in spiritual darkness or
				error; for the true source of spiritual light and life is
				Allah, and Allah alone. For (2) the Night and (3) the
				Dawn, see the following note.

				(2) The Night when it is illuminated by the Moon is light
				in a sense, but it is really dark and must give place to
				(3) the Dawn when it comes, as the harbinger of the Sun.

				responsibility, it will look less and less to reflected
				lights, and through the beauty of a dawn-like awakening,
				will be prepared more and more for the splendour of the
				light of Allah Himself, the goal of the Heaven of our

			To any of you that chooses to press forward or to follow behind

				Three interpretations are possible. (1) Those pressing
				forward may be the Righteous, and those following behind
				may be the laggards, the Unbelievers, who reject Allah's
				love, care, and mercy. (2) Men of two kinds of
				temperament may be referred to: those who are always in
				the van and those who are always in the rear. Allah's
				Message is open to both. But there may be a danger to
				both: in the one case, over-confindence, or hope in wrong
				things: in the other case missing great opportunities so
				that their spiritual lives may be "bound in shallows and
				in miseries". Extremes should be avoided. (3) Or it may
				mean that the warning is effective only for those willing
				to move forwards or backwards, as the case may be, but is
				lost on the inert or the lethargic. For our moral and
				spiritual progress, we have in some cases to go forwards,
				but in some cases we have to retreat from false

			And celebrate the name of thy Lord morning and evening
			<fn>5856</fn>
			<note id="5856">
				Three methods of Prayer and Devotion are mentioned: (1)
				to remember and celebrate the holy name of Allah always;
				(2) to spend a part of the night in humble prostration;
				and (3) to glorify Him in the long hours of a weary night
				of waiting and watching. As to (1), "morning and evening"
				means all the waking hours of our life, but in the
				special hours of morning and evening the physical world
				without us, and the inner world within us, combine to
				make us specially receptive of spiritual influences. The
				"name" of Allah includes His attributes, as a locked
				golden casket might include priceless jewels. Any one may
				carry the casket, even though he may not be worthy to
				handle the jewels. If he carries the casket, he is in
				potential possession of the jewels, and he hopes some
				time to get the key which opens the jewels to him. So the
				tyro, who celebrates the holy name of Allah, hopes some
				day to see the "Face" of Allah and be blessed with the
				privilege of proximity to His Person. For (2) and (3) see

		<ayah num="1">
			By the (Winds) Sent Forth one after another (to man's profit);
			<fn>5863</fn> <fn>5864</fn>
			<note id="5863">
				This Sura begins with an appeal to five things, as
				pointing to the substantive statement in verse 7, that
				the Day of Justice and Judgment is bound to come, and we
				must prepare for it. It is difficult to translate, but
				easy to understand, if we remember that a triple thread
				of allegory runs through this passage (verses 1-7). The
				five things or phases, which will be presently considered
				in detail, refer to (a) Winds in the physical world, (b)
				Angels in the Kingdom of Allah, and (c) Prophets in the
				human world, connecting it with the Kingdom of Allah.
			</note>
			<note id="5864">
				Understanding the reference to Winds, we can see that
				they are powerful factors in the government of the
				physical world. (1) They come gently as harbingers of the
				blessings of rain and fertility (xv. 22; xxx. 48); but
				(2) they can come as violent tornadoes, uprooting and
				destroying (li. 41-42); (3) they can scatter seeds far
				and wide, and (4) they can separate chaff from grain, or
				clear the air from epidemics; and (5) they literally
				carry sound, and therefore Messages. All these things
				point to the power and goodness of Allah, and we are
				asked to believe that His promise of Mercy and Justice in
				the Hereafter is indeed true. Cf. this passage with li.
				1-6 (Zariyat) with which it has many affinities.

				If we understand the reference to be, not to Winds, but
				to Angels, they are agencies in the Kingdom of Allah,
				which carry out similar functions, changing and
				revolutionising the face of the world. (1) They come
				softly, on beneficent errands of Mercy; (2) they are
				charged with the mission of punishment and destruction
				for sin as in the case of the two angels who came to Lut
				(xv. 57-66); (3) they distribute Allah's Mercies as the
				Winds distribute good seeds; (4) they sort out the good
				from the evil among men; and (5) they are the agency
				through which Allah's Messages and Revelations are
				conveyed to the Prophets (see No. 5 in the last note).

			<note id="5866">
				If we understand the reference to Prophets or Messengers
				of Allah, or the verses of Revelation which would be
				particularly appropriate for verses 5-6, we also get a
				satisfactory solution of the Allegory. (1) The Prophets
				have followed one another in a series: the verses of the
				Qur-an came, one after another as needed; in both cases
				it was for man's spiritual profit; (2) they caused great
				disturbance in a spiritual decadent world; they pulled
				down evil institutions root and branch, and substituted
				new ones; (3) they proclaimed their truths far and wide,
				without fear and without favour; (4) through them were
				sorted out men of Faith and rebels against Allah's Law;
				and (5) they gave a Message, through which just men were
				justified through repentance, and evil men were warned of
				their sins. Some Commentators take one or other of these
				allegories, and some apply one allegory to a few of these
				verses, and another to another few. In my opinion the
				Allegory is wide enough to comprehend all the meanings
				which I have sketched. I wish a translation could do
				justice to those marvellously terse sentences in the
				original.

			The living and the dead <fn>5875</fn>
			<note id="5875">
				What a wonderful parable! The earth is a place where
				death and life, decay and growth and decay, green grass,
				stubble, and fuel, corruption and purification jostle
				together,-one often leading to the other. The drama which
				we see with our own eyes in this world should enable us
				to appreciate the wonders in the Kingdom of Allah where
				the despised and rejected receive the highest honour,
				Lazarus rests in Abraham's bosom, and the Pharaoh is led
				in chains for his arrogance and his sin.

			And made therein mountains standing firm lofty (in stature); and

			<note id="5876">
				See n. 2038 to xvi. 15. The solid mountains are
				frequently referred to: cf. xiii. 3. The parable here is
				that the mountains are hard, solid rock, and yet they act
				as sponges to collect, store up, and filter sweet and
				wholesome water, which on account of their altitude they
				are able to distribute by gravity to the lower, dry land
				by means of rivers or springs. Any one who has seen the
				parched Makkan valleys and the delicious springs in the
				mountains around, or the Zubaida Canal, which used to be
				the main source of Makkah's water-supply, will appreciate
				the aptness of the metaphor, but it applies to any
				country, though not to so striking a degree. If the
				wisdom and power of Allah can do such things before your
				eyes, how can you reject His teaching of a still more
				wonderful future Life?

			Concerning the Great News <fn>5889</fn>
			<note id="5889">
				Great News: usually understood to mean the News or
				Message of the Resurrection or the Hereafter, about which
				there are various schools of thought among the Jews and
				Christians and other nations. There is practically
				nothing about the Resurrection in the Old Testament, and
				the Jewish sect of Sadducees even in the time of Christ
				denied the Resurrection altogether. The Pagan ideas of a
				future life-if any-varied from place to place and from
				time to time. Even in the early Christian Church, as we
				learn from Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians, there
				were contentions in that little community (1,
				Corinthians, i. 11), and some definitely denied the
				resurrection of the dead (ib., xv. 12). Great News may
				also be translated Great Message or a Message Supreme as
				I have translated at xxxviii. 67. In that case it would
				refer to the Qur-an, or the Message of Revelation, or the
				Message of the Holy Prophet, about which there was great
				contention in those days. As this Message also lays great
				stress on the Day of Judgment and the Resurrection, the
				practical result by either mode of interpretation amounts
				to the same.

				all the time. Let us therefore tum back to Allah in

				to anyone at any time, and we must all be ready for it.

				interpretation, which is that angels are referred to as
				the agency which in their dealings with mankind show
				clearly Allah's Justice, Power, and Mercy, which again
				point to the Judgment to come, as a certainty which none
				can evade. The first point, referred to in this verse, is
				that the souls of the wicked are loath to part with their
				material body at death, but their will will not count:
				their souls will be wrenched out into another world. Who
				will then deny Resurrection and Judgment?

				At all times there are errands of mercy and blessing and
				errands of justice, which the angels are prompt to
				execute by order of Allah. There are three features of
				this, thus giving the third, fourth, and fifth points.
				(3) Their movement is compared to that of gliding or
				swimming (sabhan). In xxi. 33 this verb is applied to the
				motion of the celestial bodies: they all "swim along,
				each in its rounded course". Cf. Shakespeare, Merchant of
				Venice: "There's not an orb which thou behold'st, But in
				his motion like an angel sings, Still quiring to the
				young-eyed cherubims". (4) In hurrying on their errands
				the angels press forth as in a race. (5) And thus they
				promptly execute the orders of their Lord.

				an earthquake destroying all land-marks. But that will

			Woe to those that deal in fraud <fn>6011</fn>

				"Fraud" must here be taken in a widely general sense. It
				covers giving short measure or short weight, but it
				covers much more than that. The next two verses make it
				clear that it is the spirit of injustice that is
				condemned, giving too little and asking too much. This
				may be shown in commercial dealings, where a man exacts a
				higher standard in his own favour than he is willing to
				concede as against him. In domestic or social matters an
				individual or group may ask for honour, or respect, or
				services which he or they are not willing to give on
				their side in similar circumstances. It is worse than
				one-sided selfishness: for it is double injustice. But it
				is worst of all in religion or spiritual life: with what
				face can a man ask for Mercy or Love from Allah when he
				is unwilling to give it to his fellow-men? In one aspect
				this is a statement of the Golden Rule. 'Do as you would
				be done by'. But it is more completely expressed. You

				Here is an appeal to three Signs in verses 1-3, and the

				The literal meaning is clear, but its metaphorical

				witness may be the deed or crime, or the Sinner against

			Woe to the makers of the pit (of Fire) <fn>6055</fn>
			<note id="6055">
				Who were the makers of the pit of fire in which they burn
				people for their Faith? The words are perfectly general,
				and we need not search for particular names, except by
				way of illustration. In ancient history, and in Medieval
				Europe, many lives were sacrificed at the stake because
				the victims did not conform to the established religion.
				In Arab tradition there is the story of Abraham: Nimrud
				tries to burn him to death, but on account of Abraham's
				Faith, the fire became "a means of safety for Abraham":
				xxi. 69, and n. 2725. Another case cited is that of
				Zu-Nuwas, the last Himyarite King of Yemen, by religion a
				Jew, who persecuted the Christians of Najran and is said
				to have burnt them to death. He seems to have lived in
				the latter half of the sixth Christian century, in the
				generation immediately preceding the Prophet's birth in
				570 A.D. While the words are perfectly general, a
				reference is suggested to the persecution to which the
				early Muslims were subjected by the Pagan Quraish. Among
				other cruelties, they were stripped, and their skins were
				exposed to the burning rays of the Arabian summer sun.

				Testament recognises that Abraham was a prophet (Gen. xx.
				7). There is a book in Greek, which has been translated

				(published by the Society for the Promotion of Christian
				Knowledge, London, 1927). It seems to be a Greek

				From the most ancient times Makkah was the centre of Arab

				with it: see ii. 125-127 and notes, also n. 217 to ii.
				197. In times of Paganism various superstitions were
				introduced, which Islam swept away. Islam also purified
				the rites and ceremonies, giving them new meaning. The
				ten days specially devoted to the Hajj introduce a
				striking contrast in the life of Makkah and of the
				pilgrims. Makkah, from being a quiet secluded city, is
				then thronged with thousands of pilgrims from all parts
				of the world. They discard their ordinary
				dress-representing every kind of costume-to the simple
				and ordinary Ihram (n. 217); they refrain from every kind
				of fighting and quarrel; they abstain from every kind of

				pairs: see xxxvi. 36, and n. 3981. In the animal world
				pairs are but two individuals, and yet each is a
				complement of the other. Both abstract and concrete
				things are often understood in contrast with their

				As usual, there is the particular assurance to the Holy
				Prophet, and the general asssurance to mankind: see the
				Introduction to this Sura. The early years of the
				Prophet's ministry might well have seemed blank. After
				inspiration there were days and periods of waiting. A
				sense of loneliness might well have weighed on his mind.
				His own tribe of the Quraish jeered at him, taunted and
				threatened him, and slandered and persecuted him as well
				as those who believe in him. But his faith was never
				shaken, not even to the extent of that cry of agony of
				Jesus: "My God! why hast Thou forsaken me?": (Mark, xvi.
				34). Much less did it enter the Prophet's mind to think
				that Allah was angry with him, as the taunts of his

				overcome with a sense of loneliness in his early
				struggles or difficulties. The end will crown his work.
				Allah's care is always around him. If unsympathetic or
				hostile critics laugh at him or taunt him with being,
				"mad" or "old-fashioned" or "ploughing his lonely

				(2) The holy Prophet was born in the midst of the

				no implication whatever of sin or error on his part. But
				we may err and find ourselves wandering in mazes of
				error, in thought, motive, or understanding: we must pray
				for Allah's grace ever to give us guidance. The Arabic
				root dhalla has various shades of meaning. In i. 7, I
				have translated it by the verb "stray". In liii. 2 the
				Prophet is defended from the charge of being "astray" or
				straying in mind. In xii. 9 and xii. 95 Jacob's sons use
				the word for their aged father, to suggest that he was

				contemporaries, who frequently took advantage of the
				helpless position of orphans, and in any case looked upon
				them as subordinate creatures to be repressed and kept in
				their place. Such an attitude is common in all ages.
				Helpless creatures ought, on the contrary, to be treated

			By the Fig and the Olive <fn>6194</fn> <fn>6195</fn>
			<note id="6194">
				The substantive proposition is in verses 4-8, and it is
				clinched by an appeal to four sacred symbols, viz., the
				Fig, the Olive, Mount Sinai, and the sacred City of
				Makkah. About the precise interpretation of the first two
				symbols, and especially of the symbol of the Fig, there
				is much difference of opinion. If we take the Fig
				literally to refer to the fruit or the tree, it can stand
				as a symbol of man's destiny in many ways. Under
				cultivation it can be one of the finest, most delicious,
				and most wholesome fruits in existence: in its wild
				state, it is nothing but tiny seeds, and is insipid, and
				often full of worms and maggots. So man at his best has a
				noble destiny: at his worst, he is "the lowest of the
				low". Christ is said to have cursed a fig tree for having
				only leaves, and not producing fruit (Matt. xxi. 18-20),
				enforcing the same lesson. There is also a parable of the
				fig tree in Matt. xxiv. 32-35. See also the parable of
				the good and evil figs in Jeremiah, xxiv. 1-10. But see
				n. 6198 below.

				For the sacred symbolism of the Olive, see n. 2880 to
				xxiii. 20, and notes 3000- 3002 to xxiv. 35, where the
				parable of Allah's Light includes a reference to the
				Olive. But it is possible that the Olive here refers to
				the Mount of Olives, just outside the walls of the City
				of Jerusalem (see n. 5038 to Iii. 2), for this is the
				scene in the Gospel story (Matt. xxiv. 3-4) of Christ's

				The first thing we have to note is that His nature is so
				sublime, so far beyond our limited conceptions, that the
				best way in which we can realise Him is to feel that He
				is a Personality, "He", and not a mere abstract
				conception of philosophy. He is near us; He cares for us;
				we owe our existence to Him. Secondly, He is the One and
				Only God, the Only One to Whom worship is due; all other
				things or beings that we can think of are His creatures
				and in no way comparable to Him. Thirdly, He is Eternal,
				without beginning or end, Absolute, not limited by time
				or place or circumstance, the Reality. Fourthly, we must
				not think of Him as having a son or a father, for that

			<note id="6304">
				The darkness of the night, physical darkness, is a good
				type of physical dangers and difficulties. Many people
				are afraid of physical darkness, and all are afraid of
				physical injuries, accidents, and calamities. We should
				not fear, but having taken reasonable precautions, trust

			<note id="6305">
				Those (feminine) who blow on knots', this having been a
				favourite form of witchcraft practised by perverted
				women. Such secret arts cause psychological terror. They
				may be what is called magic, or secret plottings, or the
				display of false and seductive charms (iii. 14), or the
				spreading of false and secret rumours or slanders to
				frighten men or deter them from right action. There is
				fraud in such things, but men are swayed by it. They
				should cast off fear and do their duty.

		<ayah num="1">
			Say: I seek refuge with the Lord and Cherisher of Mankind
			<fn>6307</fn> <fn>6308</fn>
			<note id="6307">
				The previous Sura pointed to the necessity of seeking
				Allah's protection against external factors which might
				affect an individual. Here the need of protection from
				internal factors, mankind being viewed as a whole, is
				pointed out. For this reason the threefold relation in
				which man stands to Allah is mentioned, as explained in
				the next note.
			</note>
			<note id="6308">
				Man's relation to Allah may be viewed in three aspects:
				(1) Allah is his Lord, Maker, and Cherisher; Allah
				sustains him and cares for him; He provides him with all
				the means for his growth and development, and for his
				protection against evil; (2) Allah is his king or ruler;
				more than any earthly king, Allah has authority to guide
				man's conduct, and lead him to ways which will make for
				his welfare; and He has given him laws; and (3) Allah is
				He to Whom mankind must return, to give an account of all
				their deeds in this life (ii. 156); Allah will be the
				Judge; He is the goal of the Hereafter, and the only
				Being entitied to man's worship at any time. From all
				these aspects man could and should seek Allah's
				protection against evil.

			From the mischief of the Whisperer (of Evil) who withdraws (after

			<note id="6309">
				Evil insinuates itself in all sorts of insidious ways
				from within so as to sap man's will, which was given to
				man by Allah. This power of evil may be Satan, or evil
				men or the evil inclinations within man's own will: for
				there are "evil ones among men and Jinns, inspiring each
				other with flowery discourses by way of deception" (vi.
				112). They secretly whisper evil and then withdraw, to
				make their net the more subtle and alluring.

				This last clause amplifies the description of the sources
				from which the whisper of evil may emanate: they may be
				men whom you may see or invisible spirits of evil working
				within. See last note. So long as we put ourselves in
				Allah's protection, and trust in Allah, evil cannot
				really touch us in our essential and inner life.
