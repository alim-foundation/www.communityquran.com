			<p>
				This Surah is named Al-Fatiha because of its
				subject-matter. Fatiha is that which opens a subject or a
				book or any other thing. In other words, Al-Fatihah is a
				sort of preface.
			</p>

		<section heading="Verses">
			<p>
				This Surah has a total of 7 verses.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				It is one of the very earliest Revelations to the Holy
				Prophet. As a matter of fact, we learn from authentic
				Traditions that it was the first complete Surah which was
				revealed to Muhammed (PBUH). Before this, only a few
				miscellaneous verses were revealed which form parts of
				Surah Alaq, Muzzammil, Muddathir, etc.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme">
			<p>
				This Surah is in fact a prayer which Allah has taught to
				all those who want to make a study of his book. It has
				been placed at the very beginning of the book to teach
				this lesson to the reader: if you sincerely want to
				benefit from the Quran, you should offer this prayer to
				the Lord of the Universe.
			</p>
			<p>
				This preface is meant to create a strong desire in the
				heart of the reader to seek guidance from the Lord of the
				Universe, who alone can grant it. Thus Al-Fatiha
				indirectly teaches that the best thing for a man is to
				pray for guidance to the straight path, to study the
				Quran with the mental attitude of a seeker-after-truth
				and to recognize the fact that the Lord of the Universe
				is the source of all knowledge. He should, therefore,
				begin the study of the Quran with a prayer to him for
				guidance.
			</p>
			<p>
				From this theme, it becomes clear that the real relation
				between Al-Fatiha and the Quran is not that of an
				introduction to a book but that of a prayer and its
				answer. Al-Fatiha is the prayer from the servant and the
				Quran is the answer from the the Master to his prayer.
				The servant prays to Allah to show him guidance and the
				Master places the whole of the Quran before him in answer
				to his prayer, as if to say, "This is the Guidance you
				begged from Me."

			<p>
				Why the name AL-BAQARAH? AL-BAQARAH (the Cow) has been so
				named from the story of the Cow occurring in this Surah
				(vv. <a href="qa:2.67">67-73</a>). It has not, however, been used as a title to
				indicate the subject of the Surah. It will, therefore, be
				as wrong to translate the name Al-Baqarah into "The Cow"
				or "The Heifer" as to translate any English name, say
				Baker, Rice, Wolf etc., into their equivalents in other
				languages or vice versa, because this would imply that
				the Surah dealt with the subject of "The Cow". Many more
				Surahs of the Quran have been named in the same way
				because no comprehensive words exist in Arabic (in spite
				of its richness) to denote the wide scope of the subject
				discussed in them. As a matter of fact all human
				languages suffer from the same limitation.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Sequence">
			<p>
				Though it is a Madani Surah, it follows naturally a Makki
				Surah Al-Fatihah, which ended with the prayer: "Show us
				the straight way". It begins with the answer to that
				prayer, "This is the Book (that) . . . is guidance. The
				greater part of Al-Baqarah was revealed during the first
				two years of the Holy Prophet's life at Al-Madinah. The
				smaller part which was revealed at a later period has
				been included in this Surah because its contents are
				closely related to those dealt with in this Surah. For
				instance, the verses prohibiting interest were revealed
				during the last period of the Holy prophet's life but
				have been inserted in this Surah. For the same reason,
				the last verses (<a href="qa:2.284">284-286</a>) of this Surah which were
				revealed at Makkah before the migration of the Holy
				Prophet to Al-Madinah have also been included in it.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Historical Background">
			<p>
				In order to understand the meaning of this Surah, we
				should know its historical background:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					At Makkah the Quran generally addressed the
					mushrik Quraish who were ignorant of Islam, but
					at Al-Madinah it was also concerned with the Jews
					who were acquainted with the creed of the Unity
					of Allah, Prophethood, Revelation, the Hereafter
					and angels. They also professed to believe in the
					law which was revealed by Allah to their Prophet
					Moses (Allah's peace be upon him), and in
					principle, their way was the same (Islam) that
					was being taught by Prophet Muhammad (Allah's
					peace be upon him). But they had strayed away
					from it during the centuries of degeneration and
					had adopted many un-Islamic creeds, rites and
					customs of which there was no mention and for
					which there was no sanction in the Torah. Not
					only this: they had tampered with the Torah by
					inserting their own explanations and
					interpretations into its text. They had distorted
					even that part of the Word of God which had
					remained intact in their Scriptures and taken out
					of it the real spirit of true religion and were
					now clinging to a lifeless frame of rituals.
					Consequently their beliefs, their morals and
					their conduct had gone to the lowest depths of
					degeneration. The pity is that they were not only
					satisfied with their condition but loved to cling
					to it. Besides this, they had no intention or
					inclination to accept any kind of reform. So they
					became bitter enemies of those who came to teach
					them the Right Way and did their worst to defeat
					every such effort. Though they were originally
					Muslims, they had swerved from the real Islam and
					made innovations and alterations in it and had
					fallen victims to hair splitting and
					sectarianism. They had forgotten and forsaken
					Allah and begun to serve mammon. So much so that
					they had even given up their original name
					"Muslim" and adopted the name "Jew" instead, and
					made religion the sole monopoly of the children
					of Israel. This was their religious condition
					when the Holy Prophet went to Al-Madinah and
					invited the Jews to the true religion. That is
					why more than one third of this Surah has been
					addressed to the children of Israel. A critical
					review of their history, their moral degeneration
					and their religious perversions has been made;
					side by side with this the high standard of
					morality and the fundamental principles of the
					pure religion have been put forward in order to
					bring out clearly the nature of the degeneration
					of the community of a prophet when it goes astray
					and to draw clear lines of demarcation between
					real piety and formalism, and the essentials and
					non-essentials of the true religion.
				</li>
				<li>
					At Makkah Islam was mainly concerned with the
					propagation of its fundamental principles and the
					moral training of its followers. But after the
					migration of the Holy Prophet to Al-Madinah,
					where Muslims had come to settle from all over
					Arabia and where a tiny Islamic State had been
					set up with the help of the Ansar (local
					supporters), naturally the Quran had to turn its
					attention to the social, cultural, economic,
					political and legal problems as well. This
					accounts for the difference between the themes of
					the surahs revealed at Makkah and those at
					Al-Madinah. Accordingly about half of this Surah
					deals with those principles and regulations which
					are essential for the integration and solidarity
					of a community and for the solution of its
					problems.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				After the migration to Al-Madinah, the struggle between
				Islam and un-Islam had also entered a new phase. Before
				this the Believers, who propagated Islam among their own
				clans and tribes, had to face its opponents at their own
				risk. But the conditions had changed at Al-Madinah, where
				Muslims from all parts of Arabia had come and settled as
				one community, and had established an independent city
				state. Here it became a struggle for the survival of the
				Community itself, for the whole of non-Muslim Arabia was
				bent upon and united in crushing it totally. Hence the
				following instructions, upon which depended not only its
				success but its very survival, were revealed in this
				Surah
			</p>
			<ol type="A">
				<li>
					The Community should work with the utmost zeal to
					propagate its ideology and win over to its side
					the greatest possible number of people.
				</li>
				<li>
					It should so expose its opponents as to leave no
					room for doubt in the mind of any sensible person
					that they were adhering to an absolutely wrong
					position.
				</li>
				<li>
					It should infuse in its members (the majority of
					whom were homeless and indigent and surrounded on
					all sides by enemies) that courage and fortitude
					which is so indispensable to their very existence
					in the adverse circumstances in which they were
					struggling and to prepare them to face these
					boldly.
				</li>
				<li>
					It should also keep them ready and prepared to
					meet any armed menace, which might come from any
					side to suppress and crush their ideology, and to
					oppose it tooth and nail without minding the
					overwhelming numerical strength and the material
					resources of its enemies
				</li>
				<li>
					It should also create in them that courage which
					is needed for the eradication of evil ways and
					for the establishment of the Islamic Way instead.
					That is why Allah has revealed in this Surah such
					instructions as may help achieve all the above
					mentioned objects.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				At the time of the revelation of Al-Baqarah, all sorts of
				hypocrites had begun to appear. Allah has, therefore,
				briefly pointed out their characteristics here.
				Afterwards when their evil characteristics and
				mischievous deeds became manifest, Allah sent detailed
				instructions about them.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme: Guidance">
			<p>
				This Surah is an invitation to the Divine Guidance and
				all the stories, incidents etc., revolve round this
				central theme. As this Surah has particularly been
				addressed to the Jews, many historical events have been
				cited from their own traditions to admonish and advise
				them that their own good lies in accepting the Guidance
				revealed to the Holy Prophet. They should, therefore, be
				the first to accept it because it was basically the same
				that was revealed to Prophet Moses (Allah's peace be upon
				him).
			</p>
		</section>
	</sura>
	<sura num="3">
		<section heading="Name">
			<p>
				This Surah takes its name from <a href="qa:3.33">v. 33</a>. Al-i-Imran, like
				the names of many other surahs, is merely a name to
				distinguish it from other surahs and does not imply that
				the family of Imran has been discussed in it.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="The Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				This Surah consists of four discourses. The first
				discourse (<a href="qa:3.1">vv. 1-32</a> was probably revealed soon after the
				Battle of Badr. The second discourse (<a href="qa:3.33">vv. 33-63</a>) was
				revealed in 9 A.H. on the occasion of the visit of the
				deputation from the Christians of Najran. The third
				discourse (<a href="qa:3.64">vv. 64-120</a>) appears to have been revealed
				immediately after the first one. The fourth discourse
				(<a href="qa:3.121">vv. 121-200</a>) was revealed after the Battle of Uhud.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Subject">
			<p>
				Though these discourses were revealed at different
				periods and on different occasions, they are so
				inter-linked and so inter-connected in regard to their
				aim, object and central theme that they make together one
				continuous whole. This Surah has been especially
				addressed to two groups-the people of the Book (the Jews
				and the Christians) and the followers of Muhammad
				(Allah's peace be upon him).
			</p>
			<p>
				The message has been extended to the Jews and the
				Christians in continuation of the invitation in
				Al-Baqarah, in which they have been admonished for their
				erroneous beliefs and evil morals and advised to accept,
				as a remedy, the Truth of the Quran. They have been told
				here that Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) taught the
				same right way of life that had been preached by their
				own Prophets; that it alone was the Right Way, the way of
				Allah; hence any deviation from it will be wrong even
				according to their own Scriptures.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second group, the Muslims, who had been declared to
				be the best Community in Al-Baqarah and appointed
				torch-bearers of the Truth and entrusted with the
				responsibility of reforming the world, have been given
				additional instructions in continuation of those given in
				the preceding Surah. The Muslims have been warned to
				learn a lesson from the religious and moral degeneration
				of the former communities and to refrain from treading in
				their footsteps. Instructions have also been given about
				the reformative work they had to perform. Besides this,
				they have been taught how to deal with the people of the
				Book and the hypocrites who were putting different kinds
				of hindrances in the way of Allah. Above all, they have
				been warned to guard against those weaknesses which had
				come to the surface in the Battle of Uhud.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Background">
			<p>
				The following is the background of the Surah: 
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					The Believers had met with all sorts of trials
					and hardships about which they had been
					forewarned in Al-Baqarah. Though they had come
					out victorious in the Battle of Badr, they were
					not out of danger yet. Their victory had aroused
					the enmity of all those powers in Arabia which
					were opposed to the Islamic Movement. Signs of
					threatening storms had begun to appear on all
					sides and the Muslims were in a perpetual state
					of fear and anxiety. It looked as if the whole
					Arabian world around the tiny state of
					Al-Madinah-which was no more than a village state
					at that time-was bent upon blotting out its very
					existence. This state of war was also adversely
					affecting its economy, which had already been
					badly disturbed by the influx of the Muslim
					refugees from Makkah.
				</li>
				<li>
					Then there was the disturbing problem of the
					Jewish clans who lived in the suburbs of
					Al-Madinah. They were discarding the treaties of
					alliance they had made with the Holy Prophet
					after his migration from Makkah. So much so that
					on the occasion of the Battle of Badr, these
					people of the Book syrnpathised with the evil
					aims of the idolaters, in spite of the fact that
					their fundamental articles of the Faith-Oneness
					of Allah, Prophethood, Life-after- death-were the
					same as those of the Muslims. After the Battle of
					Badr, they openly began to incite the Quraish and
					other Arab clans to wreak their vengeance on the
					Muslims. Thus those Jewish clans set aside their
					centuries-old friendly and neighborly relations
					with the people of Al-Madinah. At last when their
					mischievous actions and breaches of treaties
					became unbearable, the Holy Prophet attacked the
					Bani-Qainu-qa'a, the most mischievous of all the
					other Jewish clans who had conspired with the
					hypocrites of Al-Madinah and the idolatrous Arab
					clans to encircle the Believers on all sides. The
					magnitude of the peril might be judged from the
					fact that even the life of the Holy Prophet
					himself was always in danger. Therefore his
					Companions slept in their armors during that
					period and kept watch at night to guard against
					any sudden attack, and whenever the Holy Prophet
					happened to be out of sight even for a short
					while, they would at once set out in search of
					him.
				</li>
				<li>
					This incitement by the Jews added fuel to the
					fire which was burning in the hearts of the
					Quraish and they began to make preparations to
					avenge the defeat they had suffered at Bad. A
					year after this an army of 3,000 strong marched
					out of Makkah to invade Al-Madinah and a battle
					took place at the foot of Mount Uhud. The Holy
					Prophet came out of Al-Madinah with one thousand
					men to meet the enemy. While they were marching
					to the battle-field, three hundred hypocrites
					deserted the army and returned to Al-Madinah, but
					there still remained a small band of hypocrites
					among the seven hundred who accompanied the Holy
					Prophet. They played their part and did their
					worst to create mischief and chaos in the ranks
					of the Believers during the Battle. This was the
					first clear indication of the fact that within
					the fold of the Muslim Community there was quite
					a large number of saboteurs who were always ready
					to conspire with the external enemies to harm
					their own brethren.
				</li>
				<li>
					Though the devices of the hypocrites had played a
					great part in the set-back at Uhud, the
					weaknesses of the Muslims themselves contributed
					no less to it. And it was but natural that the
					Muslims should show signs of moral weakness for
					they were a new community which had only recently
					been formed on a new ideology and had not as yet
					got a thorough moral training. Naturally in this
					second hard test of their physical and moral
					strength, some weaknesses came to the surface.
					That is why a detailed review of the Battle of
					Uhud was needed to warn the Muslims of their
					shortcomings and to issue instructions for their
					reform. It should also be noted that this review
					of the Battle is quite different from the reviews
					that are usually made by generals on similar
					occasions.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</section>
		<section heading="Subject: Guidance">
			<p>
				This Surah is the sequel to Al-Baqarah and the invitation
				therein is continued to the people of the Book. In
				Al-Baqarah the Jews were pointedly invited to accept the
				Guidance and in this Surah the Christians have
				particularly been admonished to give up their erroneous
				beliefs and accept the Guidance of the Quran. At the same
				time, the Muslims have been instructed to nourish the
				virtues that may enable them to carry out their
				obligations and spread the Divine Guidance.
			</p>
		</section>
	</sura>
	<sura num="4">
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				This Surah comprises several discourses which were
				revealed on different occasions during the period ranging
				probably between the end of A.H. 3 and the end of A.H. 4
				or the beginning of A.H. 5. Although it is difficult to
				determine the exact dates of their revelations, yet it is
				possible to assign to them a fairly correct period with
				the help of the Commandments and the events mentioned
				therein and the Traditions concerning them. A few
				instances are given below by way of illustration.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					We know that the instructions about the division
					of inheritance of the martyrs and for the
					safeguard of the rights of the orphans were sent
					down after the Battle of Uhud in which 70 Muslims
					were killed. Then naturally the question of the
					division of the inheritance of the martyrs and
					the safeguard of the rights of their orphans
					arose in many families at Al-Madinah. From this
					we conclude that <a href="qa:4.1">vv. 1-28</a> were revealed on that
					occasion.
				</li>
				<li>
					We learn from the Traditions that the Commandment
					about salat during war time was given on the
					occasion of Zat-ur-Riqa'a, an expedition which
					took place in A.H. 4. From this we conclude that
					the discourse containing <a href="qa:4.102">v. 102</a> was revealed on
					that occasion.
				</li>
				<li>
					The last warning (v. 47) to the Jews was given
					before the Banu Nadir were exiled from Al-Madinah
					in Rabi'-ul Awwal, A.H. 4. From this it may
					safely be concluded that the discourse containing
					v. 47 must have been revealed some time before
					that date.
				</li>
				<li>
					The permission abouttayammum (the performance of
					ablutions with pure dust, in case no water be
					available) was given during the Bani-al-Mustaliq
					expedition, which took place in A.H. 5. Therefore
					the probable period of the revelation of the
					discourse containing v. 43 was A.H. 5.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</section>
		<section heading="Topics and Their Background">
			<p>
				Let us now consider the social and historical
				considerations of the period in order to understand the
				Surah. All the discourses in this Surah deal with three
				main problems which confronted the Holy Prophet at the
				time. First of all, he was engaged in bringing about an
				all round development of the Islamic Community that had
				been formed at the time of his migration to Al-Madinah.
				For this purpose he was introducing new moral, cultural,
				social, economic and political ways in place of the old
				ones of the pre-Islamic period. The second thing that
				occupied his attention and efforts was the bitter
				struggle that was going on with the mushrik Arabs, the
				Jewish clans and the hypocrites who were opposing tooth
				and nail his mission of reform. Above all he had to
				propagate Islam in the face of the bitter opposition of
				these powers of evil with a view to capturing more and
				more minds and hearts.
			</p>
			<p>
				Accordingly, detailed instructions have been given for
				the consolidation and strengthening of the Islamic
				Community in continuation of those given in Al-Baqarah.
				Principles for the smooth running of family life have
				been laid down and ways of settling family disputes have
				been taught. Rules have been prescribed for marriage and
				rights of wife and husband have been apportioned fairly
				and equitably. The status of women in the society has
				been determined and the declaration of the rights of
				orphans has been made laws and regulations have been laid
				down for the division of inheritance, and instructions
				have been given to reform economic affairs. The
				foundation of the penal code has been laid down, drinking
				has been prohibited, and instructions have been given for
				cleanliness and purity. The Muslims have been taught the
				kind of relations good men should have with their Allah
				and fellow men. Instructions have been given for the
				maintenance of discipline in the Muslim Community.
			</p>
			<p>
				The moral and religious condition of the people of the
				Book has been reviewed to teach lessons to the Muslims
				and to forewarn them to refrain from following in their
				footsteps. The conduct of the hypocrites has been
				criticized and the distinctive features of hypocrisy and
				true faith have been clearly marked off to enable the
				Muslims to distinguish between the two. In order to cope
				with the aftermath of the Battle of Uhud, inspiring
				discourses were sent down to urge the Muslims to face the
				enemy bravely, for the defeat in the Battle had so
				emboldened the mushrik Arab clans and the neighboring
				Jews and the hypocrites at home that they were
				threatening the Muslims on all sides. At this critical
				juncture, Allah filled the Muslims with courage and gave
				them such instructions as were needed during that period
				of war clouds. In order to counteract the fearful rumors
				that were being spread by the hypocrites and the Muslims
				of weak faith, they were asked to make a thorough inquiry
				into them and to inform the responsible people about
				them. Then they were experiencing some difficulties in
				offering their salat during the expeditions to some
				places where no water was available for performing their
				ablutions, etc. In such cases they were allowed to
				cleanse themselves with pure earth and to shorten the
				salat or to offer the "Salat of Fear", when they were
				faced with danger. Instructions were also given for the
				solution of the puzzling problem of those Muslims!who
				were scattered among the unbelieving Arab clans and were
				often involved in war. They were asked to migrate to
				Al-Madinah, the abode of Islam.
			</p>
			<p>
				This Surah also deals with the case of Bani Nadir who
				were showing a hostile and menacing attitude, in spite of
				the peace treaties they had made with the Muslims. They
				were openly siding with the enemies of Islam and hatching
				plots against the Holy Prophet and the Muslim Community
				even at Al-Madinah itself. They were taken to task for
				their inimical behavior and given a final warning to
				change their attitude, and were at last exiled from
				Al-Madinah on account of their misconduct.
			</p>
			<p>
				The problem of the hypocrites, who had become very
				troublesome at that time, was involving the Believers in
				difficulties. Therefore they were divided into different
				categories to enable the Muslims to deal with them
				appropriately. Clear instructions were also given
				regarding the attitude they should adopt towards the
				non-belligerent clans. The most important thing needed at
				that time was to prepare the Muslims for the bitter
				struggle with the opponents of Islam. For this purpose
				greatest importance was attached to their character
				building, for it was obvious that the small Muslim
				Community could only come out successful, nay, survive,
				if the Muslims possessed high moral character. They were,
				therefore, enjoined to adopt the highest moral qualities
				and were severely criticized whenever any moral weakness
				was detected in them.
			</p>
			<p>
				Though this Surah mainly deals with the moral and social
				reforms, yet due attention has been paid to propagation
				of Islam. On the one hand, the superiority of the Islamic
				morality and culture has been established over that of
				the Jews, Christians and mushriks; on the other hand,
				their wrong religious conceptions, their wrong morality
				and their evil acts have been criticized to prepare the
				ground for inviting them to the way of the Truth.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Subject: Consolidation of the Islamic Community">
			<p>
				The main object of this Surah is to teach the Muslims the
				ways that unite a people and make them firm and strong.
				Introductions for the stability of family, which is the
				nucleus of community have been given. Then they have been
				urged to prepare themselves for defense. Side by side
				with these, they have been taught the importance of the
				propagation of Islam. Above all, the importance of the
				highest moral character in the scheme of consolidation of
				the Community has been impressed.

	<sura num="5">
		<section heading="Name">
			<p>
				This Surah takes its name from verse 112 in which the
				word Mai'dah occurs. Like the names of many other surahs,
				this name has no special relation to the subject of the
				Surah but has been used merely as a symbol to distinguish
				it from other surahs:
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				The theme of this Surah indicates, and traditions support
				it, that it was revealed after the treaty of Hudaibiyah
				at the end of 6 A.H. or in the beginning of 7 A.H. That
				is why it deals with those problems that arose from this
				treaty.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Holy Prophet with 1400 Muslims went to Makkah in
				Zil-Qaadah 6 A.H. to perform Umrah, but the Quraish,
				spurred by their enmity, prevented him from its
				performance, though it was utterly against all the
				ancient religious traditions of Arabia. After a good deal
				of hard and harsh negotiations, a treaty was concluded at
				Hudaibiyah according to which it was agreed that he could
				perform Umrah the following year. That was a very
				appropriate occasion for teaching the Muslims the right
				way of performing a pilgrimage to Makkah with the true
				Islamic dignity, and enjoining that they should not
				prevent the disbelievers from performing pilgrimage to
				Makkah as a retaliation for their misbehavior. This was
				not difficult at all as many disbelievers had to pass
				through Muslim territory on their way to Makkah. This is
				why the introductory verses deal with the things
				connected with pilgrimage to Makkah and the same theme
				has been resumed in vv. 101-104. The other topics of this
				Surah also appear to belong to the same period.
			</p>
			<p>
				The continuity of the subject shows that most probably
				the whole of the surah was revealed as a single discourse
				at one and the same time. It is also possible that some
				of its verses were revealed at a later period and
				inserted in this Surah at different places where they
				fitted in. But there appears to be not the least gap
				anywhere in the surah to show that it might have
				comprised two or more discourses. 
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Occasion of Revelation. ">
			<p>
				This Surah was revealed to suit the requirements of the
				changed conditions which were now different from those
				prevailing at the time of the revelation of Al-i-'Imran
				and An-Nisa. Then the shock of the set-back at Uhud had
				made the very surroundings of Al-Madinah dangerous for
				the Muslims, but now Islam had become an invulnerable
				power and the Islamic State had extended to Najd on the
				east, to the Red Sea on the west, to Syria on the north
				and to Makkah on the south. This set-back which the
				Muslims had suffered at Uhud had not broken their
				determination. It had rather spurred them to action. As a
				result of their continuous struggle and unparalleled
				sacrifices, the power of. the surrounding clans, within a
				radius of 200 miles or so, had been broken. The Jewish
				menace which was always threatening Al-Madinah had been
				totally removed and the Jews in the other parts of Hijaz
				had become tributaries of the State of Al-Madinah. The
				last effort of the Quraish to suppress Islam had been
				thwarted in the Battle of the Ditch. After this, it had
				become quite obvious to the Arabs that no power could
				suppress the Islamic movement. Now Islam was not merely a
				creed which ruled over the minds and hearts of the people
				but had also become a State which dominated over every
				aspect of the life of the people who lived within its
				boundaries. This had enabled the Muslims to live their
				lives without let or hindrance, in accordance with their
				beliefs.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another development had also taken place during this
				period. The Muslim civilization had developed in
				accordance with the principles of Islam and the Islamic
				viewpoint. This civilization was quite distinct from all
				other civilizations in all its details, and distinguished
				the Muslims clearly from the non Muslims in their moral,
				social and cultural behavior. Mosques had been built in
				all territories, prayer had been established and Imam
				(leader) for every habitation and clan had been
				appointed. The Islamic civil and criminal laws had been
				formulated in detail and were being enforced through the
				Islamic courts. New and reformed ways of trade and
				commerce had taken the place of the old ones. The Islamic
				laws of marriage and divorce, of the segregation of the
				sexes, of the punishment for adultery and calumny and the
				like had cast the social life of the Muslims in a special
				mould. Their social behavior, their conversation, their
				dress, their very mode of living, their culture etc., had
				taken a definite shape of its own. As a result of all
				these changes, the non-Muslims could not expect that the
				Muslims would ever return to their former fold. Before
				the treaty of Hudaibiyah, the Muslims were so engaged in
				their struggle with the non-Muslim Quraish that they got
				no time to propagate their message. This hindrance was
				removed by what was apparently a defeat but in reality a
				victory at Hudaibiyah. This gave the Muslims not only
				peace in their own territory but also respite to spread
				their message in the surrounding territories. Accordingly
				the Holy Prophet addressed letters to the rulers of Iran,
				Egypt and the Roman Empire and the chiefs of Arabia,
				inviting them to Islam. At the same time the missionaries
				of Islam spread among the clans and tribes and invited
				them to accept the Divine Way of Allah. These were the
				circumstances at the time when Al-Ma'idah was revealed.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Topics">
			<p>
				It deals with the following three main topics: 
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Commandments and instructions about the
					religious, cultural and political life of the
					Muslims. In this connection, a code of ceremonial
					rules concerning the journey for Hajj has been
					prescribed; the observance of strict respect for
					the emblems of Allah has been enjoined; and any
					kind of obstruction or interference with the
					pilgrims to the Kaabah has been prohibited.
					Definite rules and regulations have been laid
					down for what is lawful and unlawful in the
					matter of food, and self-imposed foolish
					restrictions of the pre-Islamic age have been
					abolished. Permission has been given to take food
					with the people of the Book and to marry their
					women. Rules and regulations for the performance
					of Wudu (ablutions) and bath and purification and
					tayammum (ablutions with dust) have been
					prescribed. Punishment for rebellion, disturbance
					of peace and theft have been specified. Drinking
					and gambling have absolutely been made unlawful.
					Expiation for the breaking of oath has been laid
					down and a few more things have been added to the
					law of evidence.
				</li>
				<li>
					Admonition to the Muslims. Now that the Muslims
					had become a ruling body, it was feared that
					power might corrupt them. At this period of great
					trial, Allah had admonished them over and over
					again to stick to justice and to guard against
					the wrong behavior of their predecessors, the
					people of the Book. They have been enjoined to
					remain steadfast to the Covenant of obedience to
					Allah and His Messenger, and to observe strictly
					their commands and prohibitions in order to save
					them- selves from the evil consequences which.
					befell the Jews and the Christians who had
					violated them. They have been instructed to
					observe the dictates of the Holy Quran in the
					conduct of all their affairs and warned against
					the attitude of hypocrisy.
				</li>
				<li>
					Admonition to the Jews and the Christians. As the
					power of the Jews had been totally weakened and
					almost all their habitations in north Arabia had
					come under the rule of the Muslims, they have
					been warned again about their wrong attitude and
					invited to follow the Right Way. At the same time
					a detailed invitation has also been extended to
					the Christians. The errors of their creeds have
					been clearly pointed out and they have been
					admonished to accept the guidance of the Holy
					Prophet. Incidentally, it may be noted that no
					direct invitation has been made to the Majusis
					and idolaters living in the adjoining countries,
					because there was no need for a separate address
					for them as their condition had already been
					covered by the addresses to the mushrik Arabs.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</section>
		<section heading="Subject:Consolidation of the Islamic Community.">
			<p>
				In continuation of the instructions about the
				consolidation of the Islamic Community given in Surah
				AN-NISA, the Muslims have been directed to observe and
				fulfill all their obligations: further regulations have
				been prescribed to train the Muslims for that purpose.
				They have also been particularly warned as rulers to
				guard against the corruption, of power and directed to
				observe the Covenant of the Quran. They have also been
				exhorted to learn lessons from the failings of their
				predecessors, the Jews and the Christians, who in their
				turn have been admonished to give up their wrong
				attitudes towards the Right Way and accept the guidance
				taught by Prophet Muhammad (God's peace be upon him).
			</p>
		</section>
	</sura>
	<sura num="6">
		<section heading="Name">
			<p>
				This Surah takes its name from vv. 136, 138 and 139 in
				which some superstitious beliefs of the idolatrous Arabs
				concerning the lawfulness of some cattle (anam) and the
				unlawfulness of some others have been refuted.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				According to a tradition of Ibn Abbas, the whole of the
				Surah was revealed at one sitting at Makkah. Asma, a
				daughter of Yazid and a first cousin of Hadrat Mu'az-bin
				Jahl, says, "During the revelation of this Surah, the
				Holy Prophet was riding on a she-camel and I was holding
				her nose-string. The she-camel began to feel the weight
				so heavily that it seemed as if her bones would break
				under it." We also learn from other traditions that the
				Holy Prophet dictated the whole of the Surah the same
				night that it was revealed.
			</p>
			<p>
				Its subject-matter clearly shows that it must have been
				revealed during the last year of the Holy Prophet's life
				at Makkah. The tradition of Asma, daughter of Yazid, also
				confirms this. As she belonged to the Ansar and embraced
				Islam after the migration of the Holy Prophet to Yathrab,
				her visit to the Holy Prophet at Makkah must have taken
				place during the last year of his life there. For before
				this, his relations with those people were not so
				intimate that a woman from there might have come to visit
				him at Makkah.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Occasion of Revelation">
			<p>
				After determining the period of its revelation, it is
				easier to visualize the background of the Surah. Twelve
				years had passed since the Holy Prophet had been inviting
				the people to Islam. The antagonism and persecution by
				the Quraish had become most savage and brutal, and the
				majority of the Muslims had to leave their homes and
				migrate to Habash (Abyssinia). Above all, the two great
				supporters of the Holy Prophet, Abu Talib and Hadrat
				Khadijah, were no more to help and give strength to him.
				Thus he was deprived of all the worldly support. But in
				spite of this, he carried on his mission in the teeth of
				opposition. As a result of this, on the one hand, all the
				good people of Makkah and the surrounding clans gradually
				began to accept Islam; on the other hand, the community
				as a whole, was bent upon obduracy and rejection.
				Therefore, if anyone showed any inclination towards
				Islam, he was subjected to taunts and derision, physical
				violence and social boycott. It was in these dark
				circumstances that a ray of hope gleamed from Yathrab,
				where Islam began to spread freely by the efforts of some
				influential people of Aus and Khazraj, who had embraced
				Islam at Makkah. This was a humble beginning in the march
				of Islam towards success and none could foresee at that
				time the great potentialities that lay hidden in it. For,
				to a casual observer, it appeared at that time as if
				Islam was merely a weak movement; it had no material
				backing except the meager support of the Prophet's own
				family and of the few poor adherents of the Movement.
				Obviously the latter could not give much help because
				they themselves had been cast out by their own people who
				had become their enemies and were persecuting them.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Topics">
			<p>
				These were the conditions, when this discourse was
				revealed. The main topics dealt with in this discourse
				may be divided under seven headings: 
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Refutation of shirk and invitation to the creed
					of Tawhid.
				</li>
				<li>
					Enunciation of the doctrine of the
					"Life-after-death" and refutation of the wrong
					notion that there was nothing beyond this worldly
					life. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Refutation of the prevalent superstitions. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Enunciation of the fundamental moral principles
					for the building up of the Islamic Society. 5. 
					Answers to the objections raised against the
					person of the Holy Prophet and his mission. 6.	 
					 Comfort and encouragement to the Holy Prophet
					and his followers who were at that time in a
					state of anxiety and despondency because of the
					apparent failure of the mission. 
				</li>
			</ol>
		</section>
		<section heading="The Background of Makki Surahs">
			<p>
				As this is the first long Makki Surah in the order of the
				compilation of the Quran, it will be useful to explain
				the historical background of Makki Surahs in general, so
				that the reader may easily understand the Makki Surahs
				and our references to its different stages in connection
				with our commentary on them. First of all, it should be
				noted that comparatively very little material is
				available in regard to the background of the revelation
				of Makki Surahs whereas the period of the revelation of
				all the Madani Surahs is known or can be determined with
				a little effort. There are authentic traditions even in
				regard to the occasions of the revelation of the majority
				of the verses. On the other hand, we do not have such
				detailed information regarding the Makki Surahs. There
				are only a few Surahs and verses which have authentic
				traditions concerning the time and occasion of their
				revelation. This is because the history of the Makki
				period had not been compiled in such detail as that of
				the Madani period. Therefore we have to depend on the
				internal evidence of these Surahs for determining the
				period of their revelation: for example, the topics they
				discuss, their subject. matter, their style and the
				direct or indirect references to the events and the
				occasions of their revelation. Thus it is obvious that
				with the help of such evidence as this, we cannot say
				with precision that such and such Surah or verse was
				revealed on such and such an occasion. The most we can do
				is to compare the internal evidence of a Surah with the
				events of the life of the Holy Prophet at Makkah, and
				then come to a more or less correct conclusion as to what
				particular stage a certain Surah belongs. If we keep the
				above things in view, the history of the mission of the
				Holy Prophet at Makkah can be divided into four stages.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					The first stage began with his appointment as a
					Messenger and ended with the proclamation of
					Prophethood three years later. During this period
					the Message was given secretly to some selected
					persons only, but the common people of Makkah
					were not aware of it.
				</li>
				<li>
					The second stage lasted for two years after the
					proclamation of his Prophethood. It began with
					opposition by individuals: then by and by, it
					took the shape of antagonism, ridicule,
					derision,, accusation, abuse, and false
					propaganda then gangs were formed to persecute
					those Muslims who were comparatively poor, weak
					and helpless. 
				</li>
				<li>
					The third stage lasted for about six years from
					the beginning of the persecution to the death of
					Abu Talib and Hadrat Khadijah in the tenth year
					of Prophethood. During this period, the
					persecution of the Muslims became so savage and
					brutal that many of them were forced to migrate
					to Habash. Social and economic boycott was
					applied against the Holy Prophet and the members
					of his family, and those Muslims who continued to
					stay in Makkah were forced to take refuge in
					Shi'b-i-A'bi Talib which was besieged.
				</li>
				<li>
					The fourth stage lasted for about three years
					from the tenth to the thirteenth year of
					Prophethood. This was a period of hard trials and
					grievous sufferings for the Holy Prophet and his
					followers. Life had become unendurable at Makkah
					and there appeared to be no place of refuge even
					outside it. So much so that when the Holy Prophet
					went to Ta'if, it offered no shelter or
					protection. Besides this, on the occasion of
					Hajj, he would appeal to each and every Arab clan
					to accept his invitation to Islam but met with
					blank refusal from every quarter. At the same
					time, the people of Makkah were holding counsels
					to get rid of him by killing or imprisoning or
					banishing him from their city. It was at that
					most critical time that Allah opened for Islam
					the hearts of the Ansar of Yathrab where he
					migrated at their invitation. Now that we have
					divided the life of the Holy Prophet at Makkah
					into four stages, it has become easier for us to
					tell, as far as possible, the particular stage in
					which a certain Makki Surah was revealed. This is
					because the Surahs belonging to a particular
					stage can be distinguished from those of the
					other stages with the help of their subject
					matter and style. Besides this, they also contain
					such references as throw light on the
					circumstances and events that form the background
					of their revelation. In the succeeding Makki
					Surahs, we will determine on the basis of the
					distinctive features of each stage, and point out
					in the Preface, the particular stage in which a
					certain Makki Surah was revealed.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</section>
		<section heading="Subject :Islamic Creed.">
			<p>
				This Surah mainly discusses the different aspects of the
			</p>
			<p>
				major articles of the Islamic Creed: Tawhid,
				Life-after-death, Prophethood and their practical
				application to human life. Side by side with this, it
				refutes the erroneous beliefs of the opponents and
				answers their objections, warns and admonishes them and
				comforts the Holy Prophet and his followers, who were
				then suffering from persecution. Of course, these themes
				have not been dealt with under separate heads but have
				been blended in an excellent manner.
			</p>

	<sura num="7">
		<section heading="Name">
			<p>
				This Surah takes its name from vv. 46-47 in which mention
				of A'araf occurs.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				A study of its contents clearly shows that the period of
				its revelation is about the same as that of AL-AN'AM,
				i.e., the last year of the Holy Prophet's life at Makkah,
				but it cannot be asserted with certainty which of these
				two was sent down earlier. Anyhow the manner of its
				admonition clearly indicates that it belongs to the same
				period. As both have the same historical background the
				reader should keep in view the preface to AL-AN'AM.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Topics of Discussion">
			<p>
				The principal subject of this surah is "invitation to the
				Divine Message sent down to Muhammad" (Allah's peace be
				upon him), which is couched in a warning. This is because
				the Messenger had spent a long time in admonishing the
				people of Makkah without any tangible effect on them.
				Nay, they had turned a deaf ear to his message and become
				so obdurate and antagonistic that, in accordance with the
				Divine Design, the Messenger was going to be commanded to
				leave them and turn to other people. That is why they are
				being admonished to accept the Message but, at the same
				time, they are being warned in strong terms of the
				consequences that followed the wrong attitude of the
				former people towards their Messengers. Now that the Holy
				Prophet was going to migrate from Makkah the concluding
				portion of the address has been directed towards the
				people of the Book with whom he was going to come into
				contact. This meant that the time of migration was coming
				near and the "invitation" was going to be extended to
				mankind in general, and was not to be confined to his own
				people in particular as before. During the course of the
				address to the Jews, the consequences of their
				hypocritical conduct towards Prophethood have also been
				pointed out clearly, for they professed to believe in
				Prophet Moses but in practice opposed his teachings,
				disobeyed him and worshipped falsehood and consequently
				were afflicted with ignominy and disgrace.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the end of the Surah, some instructions have been
				given to the Holy Prophet and his followers for carrying
				out the work of the propagation of Islam with wisdom. The
				most important of these is that they should show patience
				and exercise restraint in answer to the provocations of
				their opponents. Above all, they have been advised that
				under stress of the excitement of feeling, they should
				not take any wrung step that might harm their cause.

			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="The Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				It was revealed in 2 A.H. after the Battle of Badr, the
				first battle between Islam and kufr. As it contains a
				detailed and comprehensive review of the Battle, it
				appears that most probably it was revealed at one and the

				verses concerning the problems arising as a result of
				this Battle might have been revealed later and
				incorporated at the proper places to make it a continuous
				whole. At any rate, in the whole Surah there is nothing
				that might show that it is a collection of a couple of
				discourses, that have been patched up together.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Historical Background">
			<p>
				Before reviewing the Surah, it is worthwhile to consider
				the events that led to the Battle of Badr. During the
				first decade or so of the Prophethood at Makkah, the
				Message had proved its firmness, and stability. This was
				the result of two things. First, the Messenger, who
				possessed the highest qualities of character, was
				performing his Mission with wisdom, foresight and
				magnanimity. He had shown by his conduct that he had made
				up his mind to carry the movement to a successful end
				and, therefore, was ready to face all sorts of dangers
				and obstacles in the way. Secondly, the Message was so
				charming that it attracted the minds and hearts of the
				people irresistibly towards itself. So much so that all
				obstacles of ignorance, superstition and petty prejudices
				failed to check its advance. That is why the Arab
				upholders of the ways of "ignorance," who looked down
				upon it in its initial stages, had begun to reckon it as
				a serious menace during the last period of the stay of
				the Holy Prophet at Makkah, and were bent on crushing it
				with all the force at their command. But in spite of the
				above-mentioned strength, the movement still lacked
				certain things to lead it to victory
			</p>
			<p>
				First, it had not yet been fully proved that it had
				gathered round it a sufficient number of such followers
				who not only believed in its truth, but also had such an
				intense devotion to its principles that they were ready
				to expend all their energies and all that they possessed
				in the struggle for its success and establishment. So
				much so that they were ready to sacrifice their lives in
				the fight against the whole world itself even though they
				should be their own nearest relative. It is true that the
				followers of Islam had endured the severest persecutions
				at the hands of the Quraish of Makkah and had given a
				good proof of the firmness of their faith and their
				strong relation with Islam, yet further trials were
				required to show that Islam had succeeded in acquiring
				such a band of followers which considered nothing dearer
				than its ideal and was ready to sacrifice life for it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Secondly, though the voice of Islam had reached every
				part of the country, its effects were yet scattered and
				its acquired strength was spread here and there: it had
				not yet gathered sufficient force essential for a
				decisive conflict with the old established order of
				"ignorance".
			</p>
			<p>
				Thirdly, Islam had yet no home of its own and had not
				established itself firmly anywhere in the land where it
				could consolidate its power and make it a base for
				further action. For the Muslims were scattered all over
				the country and were living among the unbelievers as
				aliens whom their bloodthirsty enemies wanted to uproot
				from their own homes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Fourthly, the Muslims had not yet had an opportunity to
				demonstrate practically the blessings of the system of
				life based on Islam. There was neither any Islamic
				culture, nor any social, economic or political system;
				nor were there any established principles of war and
				peace for their guidance. Therefore the Muslims had no
				opportunity for demonstrating those moral principles on
				which they intended to build their entire system of life;
				nor had it been proved on the touchstone of trial that
				the Muslims as a community were sincere in the
				proclamation of the Message. Allah created opportunities
				for making up these deficiencies. During the last four
				years or so of the Prophet's stay at Makkah, the voice of
				Islam had been proving effective at Yathrab and the
				people for various reasons had been accepting the message
				more readily than other clans of Arabia. So much so that
				in the twelfth year of Prophethood on the occasion of
				Hajj a deputation of 75 people met the Holy Prophet in
				the darkness of night. These people not only accepted
				Islam, but also offered to give him and his followers a
				home. As this was a most epoch making opportunity
				provided by Allah, the Holy Prophet took advantage of it.
				The significance of this offer was quite clear to the
				people of Yathrab, and they fully realized that this was
				not an invitation to a mere fugitive, but to the
				Messenger of Allah so that he should become their leader
				and ruler. Likewise they knew that they were not inviting
				the Muslim refugees to give them shelter from persecution
				but to assemble them from all over the country for their
				integration with themselves to form an organized
				community. Thus the offer of the people of Yathrab was to
				make Yathrab the "City of Islam." Accordingly the Holy
				Prophet accepted their invitation and made it the first
				"City of Islam" in Arabia. And the people of Yathrab were
				fully aware of the implications of this offer. It was
				indeed a declaration of war against the whole of Arabia,
				and an invitation to their own social and economic
				boycott as well. And when the Ansar from Yathrab declared
				their allegiance to the Holy Prophet at Aqabah, they knew
				fully well its consequences. During the course of the
				formal declaration of allegiance, Asad-bin- Zurarah, the
				youngest of all the delegates from Yathrab, stood up and
				said, "O people of Yathrab! Just listen to me and
				consider the matter carefully in all its aspects. Though
				we have come to him, regarding him only as a Messenger of
				Allah, we should know that we shall be inviting the
				enmity of the whole of Arabia. For when we take him away
				to Yathrab, we shall be attacked and our children may be
				put to the sword. Therefore if you have the courage in
				your hearts to face it, then and then only, you should
				declare your allegiance to him and Allah will give you
				its reward. But if you love your lives more than him and
				his Message, then leave this matter and frankly excuse
				yourselves, for at this time Allah may accept your
				excuses."
			</p>
			<p>
				Abbas bin Ubadah bin Naalah, another member of the
				delegation, reiterated the same thing, saying, Do you
				understand the implication of the declaration of your
				allegiance to this person?" (Voices, "Yes, we know it.")
				"You are challenging the whole world to war by your
				declaration of allegiance to him. There is every
				likelihood of a serious menace to your lives and
				properties. Therefore consider it well. If you have any
				idea lurking in your minds that you will then hand him
				over to his enemies, it is much better to leave him alone
				now, because that conduct shall bring shame and disgrace
				to you in this world and the next. On the other hand, if
				you have sincerely resolved that you will endure all
				kinds of consequences that will follow as a result of
				this invitation, then it would be the best thing to take
				the oath of allegiance to him because, by God, this will
				surely bring good to you in this world as well as in the
				next world." At this all the members of the delegation
				cried with one voice, "We are ready and prepared to risk
				all our wealth and our noble kith and kin for his sake."
				It was then that the famous oath of allegiance, which is
				known as the "Second Oath of Allegiance at Aqabah" was
				taken.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the other side, the people of Makkah also understood
				fully well the implications of this matter from their own
				point of view. They realized that Muhammad (Allah's peace
				be upon him), who, they knew well, had a great
				personality and possessed extraordinary abilities, was
				going to gain a strong footing, by this allegiance. For
				this would help integrate his followers, whose constancy,
				determination, and unwavering fidelity to the Messenger
				had been tried, into a disciplined community under his
				wise leadership and guidance. And they knew that this
				would spell death for their old ways of life. They also
				realized the strategic importance of Al-Madinah to their
				trade, which was their chief means of livelihood. Its
				geographical position was such that the Muslims could
				strike with advantage at the caravans traveling on the
				trade route between Yaman and Syria, and thus strike at
				the root of their economy and that of other pagan clans
				very effectively. The value of the trade done by the
				people of Makkah alone on this route, not to count that
				of raif and other places, amounted to about two hundred
				thousand dinars annually. As the Quraish were fully aware
				of the implications of the oath of allegiance at Aqabah,
				they were greatly perturbed when they got wind of it the
				same night. At first they tried to win over the people of
				Al-Madinah to their side. But when they saw that the
				Muslims were migrating to Al- Madinah in small groups,
				they realized that the Holy Prophet was also going to
				emigrate soon from there. Then they decided to adopt an
				extreme measure to prevent this danger. A few days before
				his migration, the Quraish held a council to consider the
				matter. After a good deal of argument; they decided that
				one person should be taken from each of the families of
				Quraish other than that of Banu Hashim to put an end to
				the life of the Holy Prophet. This was to make it
				difficult for the family of the Holy Prophet to fight
				alone with all the other families of the Quraish and thus
				to force them to accept blood-money for his murder
				instead of taking revenge from them, but by the grace of
				Allah their plot against the life of the Holy Prophet
				failed because of his admirable foresight and full trust
				in Allah, and he reached Al-Madinah safe and sound. When
				they could not prevent his emigration, it occurred to
				them to exploit Abdullah bin Ub who had begun to cherish
				a grievance against the Holy Prophet since his arrival at
				Al-Madinah. He was an influential chief of Al-Madinah and
				the people had agreed to make him their king. But when
				the majority of Aus and Khazraj clan became Muslims and
				acknowledged the Holy Prophet as their leader, guide and
				ruler, all his hopes of becoming a king came to an end.
				Therefore the Quraish wrote to him, "As you have given
				shelter to our enemy, we tell you plainly that you should
				either fight with him yourself or exile him from your
				city otherwise we swear by God that we will invade your
				city, kill your males and make your females our slave
				girls." This letter added fuel to the flames of his
				jealousy and he was inclined to do some mischief, but the
				Holy Prophet took timely precautions and defeated his
				evil designs. The Quraish got another opportunity to hold
				out a threat. When Sa'ad bin Mu'az, another chief of
				Al-Madinah, went to Makkah to perform Umrah, Abu Jahl
				interrupted him at the very door of the Kaabah, saying,
				"Do you think we will let you perform Umrah in peace when
				you give shelter and help to renegades from us? Had you
				not been a guest of Ummayyah bin Khalf, you would not
				have gone alive from here." Sa'ad replied, "By Allah, if
				you prevent me from this, I will retaliate in a worse
				manner and block your route near Al-Madinah." This
				incident virtually led to a declaration from the people
				of Makkah that they would prevent the Muslims from a
				pilgrimage to the Kaabah, and from the people of
				Al-Madinah that as a retaliation they would block their
				trade route to Syria 
			</p>
			<p>
				against the opponents of Islam. As a matter of fact there
				was no other alternative for the Muslims than to keep a
				strong hold on this route so as to force the Quraish, and
				the other clans, whose interests were vitally bound with
				this route, to reconsider their inimical and antagonistic
				attitude towards them. That is why the Holy Prophet
				attached the greatest importance to this problem. As soon
				as he was free from making the preliminary arrangements
				for organizing the newly formed Muslim Community and
				settling peace terms with the neighboring Jewish
				habitations, he adopted two measures in this connection
			</p>
			<p>
				First, he entered into negotiations with those clans who
				lived between the Red Sea and this route so as to make
				alliances with them or at east to persuade them to make
				treaties of neutrality with the Muslims. He was
				successful in this, and he entered into a treaty of
				non-alignment with Juhainah, which was a very important
				clan of the hilly tract near the sea coast. Then, at the
				end of the first year of Hijrah, he made a treaty of
				defensive alliance with Bani Damrah, who lived near
				Yanb'u and Zawal Ushairah. In 2 A. H. Bani Mudlij also
				joined the alliance, as they were the neighbours and
				allies of Bani Damrah. Then it so happened that quite a
				large number of these people were converted to Islam as a
				result of the missionary work done by the Muslims.
			</p>
			<p>
				Secondly, he successively sent small bands of his men on
				this route to serve as a warning to the Quraish, and
				himself accompanied some of them. In the first year of
				Hijrah, four expeditions were sent there, that is, the
				expedition under Hamzah, the expedition under Ubaidah bin
				Harith, the expedition under Sa'ad bin Abi Waqqas and the
				Al-Abwa' expedition under the Holy Prophet himself. In
				the first month of the second year two more incursions
				were made on the same route. These are known as Buwat
				Expedition and Zawal Ushairah Expedition. Two things
				about all these expeditions are noteworthy. First, no
				blood was shed and no caravans were plundered in any of
				these expeditions. This proves that the real object of
				these expeditions was to show to the Quraish which way
				the wind was blowing. Secondly, not a single man from the
				people of Al-Madinah was sent by the Holy Prophet on any
				of these incursions. All the bands consisted purely of
				the immigrants from Makkah so that the conflict should
				remain between the people of the Quraish themselves and
				should not further spread by the involvement of other
				clans. On the other side, the Quraish of Makkah tried to
				involve others also in the conflict. When they sent bands
				towards Al-Madinah, they did not hesitate to plunder the
				people. For instance, an expedition under the leadership
				of Kurz bin Jabir al-Fihrl plundered the cattle of the
				people of Al-Madinah from the very vicinity of the city
				to show what their real intentions were.
			</p>
			<p>
				This was the state of affairs when, in Sha'aban, 2 A.H.
				(February or March, 623 A.D.) a big trade caravan of the
				Quraish, carrying goods worth $50,000 or so, with only a
				guard of thirty to forty men, on its way back from Syria
				to Makkah, reached the territory from where it could be
				easily attacked from Al-Madinah. As the caravan was
				carrying trade goods worth thousands of pounds, and was
				scantily guarded, naturally Abu Sufyan, who was in charge
				of it, from his past experience feared an attach from the
				Muslims. Accordingly, as soon as he entered the dangerous
				territory, he despatched a camel rider to Makkah with a
				frantic appeal for help. When the rider reached Makkah,
				he, following an old custom of Arabia, tore open the ears
				of his camel, cut open his nose and overturned the
				saddle. Then rending his shirt from front and behind, he
				began to cry aloud at the top of his voice, "O people of
				Quraish despatch help to protect your caravan from Syria
				under the charge of Abu Sufyan, for Muhammad with his
				followers is in pursuit of it; otherwise I don't think
				you will ever get your goods. Run, run for help." This
				caused great excitement and anger in the whole of Makkah
				and all the big chiefs of the Quraish got ready for war.
				An army, consisting of 600 armored soldiers and cavalry
				of 100 riders with great pomp and show marched out for a
				fight. They intended not only to rescue the caravan but
				also to put to an end, once for all, the new menace from
				the Muslims who had consolidated themselves at
				Al-Madinah. They wanted to crush that rising power and
				overawe the clans surrounding the route so as to make it
				absolutely secure for future trade. Now the Holy Prophet,
				who always kept himself well informed of the state of
				affairs, felt that the decisive hour has come and that
				was the right time when he must take a bold step;
				otherwise the Islamic Movement would become lifeless for
				ever and no chance would be left for it to rise again.
				For if the Quraish invaded Al-Madinah, the odds would be
				against the Muslims. The condition of the Muslim
				Community was still very shaky because the immigrants
				Muhajirin had not been able to stabilize their economy
				during the short period (less than two years) of their
				stay at Al-Madinah; their helpers, the Ansar had not yet
				been tried; and the neighbouring Jewish clans were
				antagonistic. Then there was a strong group of hypocrites
				and mushriks in Al-Madinah itself; above all, the
				surrounding clans lived in awe of the Quraish and had all
				their religious sympathies with them. The Holy Prophet,
				therefore, felt that the consequences of this possible
				invasion would not be favorable to the Muslims. The
				second possibility was that they would not invade
				Al-Madinah but try only to escort their caravan safely
				and securely by a mere show of force. In that case, too,
				if the Muslims remained inactive, it would affect their
				reputation adversely. Obviously, this weak stand in the
				conflict would embolden the other Arabs also and make the
				position of the Muslims very insecure in the country and
				the surrounding clans would, at the instance of the
				Quraish, start hostilities against them, and the Jews,
				the hypocrites and the mushriks of Al- Madinah would
				openly rise against them and not only endanger their
				security of life, property and honor but make it
				difficult for them even to live there. The Muslims would
				not be able to inspire the enemy with awe so as to keep
				safe from them their life, property and honor. A careful
				study of the situation led the Holy Prophet to make up
				his mind to take a decisive step and go into the battle
				with whatever little strength he could muster, for thus
				and thus only could he show whether the Muslim Community
				had the right to survive or was doomed to perish.
			</p>
			<p>
				When he arrived at this momentous decision, he called the
				Muhajirin and the Ansar together and placed the whole
				position before them, without any reservation. He said,
				"Allah has promised that you will confront one of the
				two, the trade caravan coming from the north or the army
				of the Quraish marching from the south. Now tell me which
				of the two you want to attack!" A large majority of the
				people replied that they wanted to attack the caravan.
				But the Holy Prophet who had something else before him,
				repeated the same question. At this Miqdad bin 'Amr, a
				Muhajir, stood up and said, "O Messenger of Allah! Please
				march to the side to which your Lord commands you; we
				will accompany you wherever you go. We will not say like
				the Israelites, 'Go and let you and your Lord fight we
				will wait'. In contrast to them we say, 'Let you and your
				Lord fight; we will fight by your side to our last
				breath'." Even then he did not announce any decision but
				waited for a reply from the Ansar who had not yet taken
				any part in any battle of Islam. As this was the first
				opportunity for them to prove that they were ready to
				fulfill their promise of fighting for the cause of Islam,
				he repeated the question without directly addressing
				them. At this, Sa'ad bin Mu'az, an Ansar, stood up and
				said, "Sir, it appears that you are putting the question
				to us." When the Holy Prophet said, "Yes", the Ansar
				replied, "We have believed in you and confirmed that what
				you have brought is the Truth, and have made a solemn
				pledge with you that we will listen to you and obey you.
				Therefore, O Messenger of Allah, do whatever you intend
				to do. We swear by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth
				that we are ready to accompany you to the sea shore and
				if you enter it, we will plunge into it. We assure you
				that not a single one of us will remain behind or forsake
				you, for we will not hesitate at all to go to fight, even
				if you should lead us to the battlefield tomorrow. We
				will remain steadfast in the battle and sacrifice our
				lives in the fight. We do hope that by the grace of Allah
				our behavior will gladden your heart. So, trusting in
				Allah's blessing, take us to the battlefield." After
				these speeches it was decided that they should march
				towards the army of the Quraish and not towards the trade
				caravan. But it should be noted that the decision was of
				an ordinary nature. For the number of people, who came
				forward to go to the battlefield, was only a little more
				than three hundred (86 Muhajirs, 62 from Aus and 170 from
				Khazraj). Then the little army was ill-armed and hardly
				equipped for battle. Only a couple of them had horses to
				ride and the others had to take their turn in threes and
				fours on the back of a camel, out of the 70 they had in
				all. Above all, they had not got enough weapons for the
				battle; only 60 of them had armors. It is, therefore, no
				wonder that with the exception of those who were prepared
				to sacrifice their lives for the cause of Islam, the
				majority of those who had joined the expedition, were so
				filled with fear that they felt as if they were knowingly
				going into the jaws of death. Then there were people who
				always looked at things from a selfish point of view.
				Though they had embraced Islam, they did not realize that
				their faith would demand the sacrifice of their lives and
				properties from them; they were of the opinion that it
				was a mad expedition prompted by irrational enthusiasm
				for religion. But the Holy Prophet and the true Believers
				had realized the urgency of that critical hour which
				required the risk of life: therefore they marched
				straight to the south-west, wherefrom the army of the
				Quraish was coming. This is a clear proof of the fact
				that from the very beginning they had gone out to fight
				with the army and not to plunder the caravan. For if they
				had aimed at plundering the caravan they would have taken
				the north-westerly direction and not the south-westerly
				one.
			</p>
			<p>
				The two parties met in combat at Badr on the seventeenth
				of Ramadan. When the two armies confronted each other and
				the Holy Prophet noticed that the Quraish army
				outnumbered the Muslims by three to one and was much
				better equipped, he raised his hands up in supplication
				and made this earnest prayer with great humility: "O
				Allah! Here are the Quraish proud of their war material:
				they have come to prove that Thy Messenger is false. O
				Allah! now send that succor that Thou hast promised to
				give me. O Allah! If this little army of Thy servants is
				destroyed, then there will be left none in the land to
				worship Thee." In this combat the emigrants from Makkah
				were put to the hardest test for they had to fight
				against their own near and dear relatives and put to the
				sword their fathers, their sons, their paternal and
				maternal uncles and their brothers. It is obvious that
				only such people could have come out successful in this
				hardest of tests as had accepted the Truth sincerely and
				cut off all relations with falsehood. And in another way
				the test to which the Ansar were put was not less hard.
				So far they had only alienated the powerful Quraish and
				their allies by giving shelter to the Muslims against
				their wishes but now, for the first time, they were going
				to give fight to them and to sow the seeds of a long and
				bitter war with them. This was indeed a very hard test
				for it meant that a small town with a population of a few
				thousand inhabitants was going to wage a war with the
				whole of Arabia. It is obvious that only such people
				could take this bold step who believed in the Truth of
				Islam so firmly that they were ready to sacrifice every
				personal interest for its sake. So Allah accepted the
				self-sacrifices of the Muhajirin and the Ansar because of
				their true faith, and rewarded them with His succor. The
				proud, well-armed Quraish were routed by these
				ill-equipped devotees of Islam. Seventy men of their army
				were killed and seventy captured as prisoners and their
				arms and equipment came into the hands of the Muslims as
				spoils of war. All their big chiefs, who were their best
				soldiers and who had led the opposition to Islam, were
				killed in this Battle. No wonder that this decisive
				victory made Islam a power to be reckoned with. A Western
				research scholar says that before the Battle of Badr,
				Islam was merely a religion and a state but after the
				Battle it became the state religion, nay, the state
				itself.

		<section heading="Topics of Discussion">
			<p>
				It is this great Battle that has been reviewed in this
				Surah. But let it be noted that in some respects this
				review is quite different from the reviews that are
				usually made by the worldly commanders after a great
				victory. Instead of gloating over the victory, the moral
				weaknesses that had come to the surface in that
				expedition have been pointed out so that the Muslims
				should try their best to reform themselves.
			</p>
			<p>
				It has been impressed upon them that the victory was due
				to the succor of Allah rather than to their own valor and
				bravery so that the Muslims should learn to rely on Him
				and obey Allah and His Messenger alone. The moral lesson
				of the conflict between the Truth and falsehood has been
				enunciated and the qualities which lead to success in a
				conflict have been explained. Then the Surah addresses
				the mushriks, the hypocrites, the Jews and the prisoners
				of this war in a very impressive manner that should teach
				them a good lesson. It also gives instructions in regard
				to the spoils of war. The Muslims have bean told not to
				regard these as their right but as a bounty from Allah.
				Therefore they should accept with gratitude the share
				that is granted to them out of it and willingly accede to
				the share which Allah sets apart for His cause and for
				the help of the needy.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then it also gives normal instructions concerning the
				laws of peace and war for these were urgently needed to
				be explained at the stage which the Islamic Movement had
				entered. It enjoined that the Muslims should refrain from
				ways of "ignorance" in peace and war and thus should
				establish their moral superiority in the world. It also
				meant, to demonstrate to the world in actual practical
				life the morality which it had been preaching to the
				world from the very beginning of Islam and had been
				enjoining that practical life should be based on the
				same. It also states some articles of the Islamic
				Constitution which help differentiate the status of the
				Muslims living within the limits of Dar-ul-Islam (the
				Abode of Islam) from that of the Muslims living beyond
				its limits.

	</sura>
	<sura num="9">
		<section heading="Name">
			<p>
				This Surah is known by two names AT-TAUBAH and
				AL-BARA'AT. It is called AT-TAUBAH because it enunciates
				the nature of taubah (repentance) and mentions the
				conditions of its acceptance.(vv. 102. 118). The second
				name BARA' AT (Release) is taken from the first word of
				the Surah.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Why Omission of Bismillah">
			<p>
				This is the only Surah of the Quran to which Bismillah is
				not prefixed. Though the commentators have given
				different reasons for this, the correct one that which
				has been given by Imam Razi: namely, this is because the
				Holy Prophet himself did not dictate it at the beginning
				of the Surah. Therefore the Companions did not prefix it
				and their successors followed them. This is a further
				proof of the fact that utmost care has been taken to keep
				the Quran intact so that it should remain in its complete
				and original form.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Discourses and Periods of Revelation">
			<p>
				This Surah comprises three discourses. The first
				discourse (vv. 1-37), was revealed in Zil-Qa'adah A.H. 9
				or thereabouts. As the importance of the subject of the
				discourse required its declaration on the occasion of
				Hajj the Holy Prophet despatched Hadrat Ali to follow
				Hadrat Abu Bakr, who had already left for Makkah as
				leader of the Pilgrims to the Kaabah. He instructed
				Hadrat Ali to deliver the discourse before the
				representatives of the different clans of Arabia so as to
				inform them of the new policy towards the mushriks.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second discourse (vv., 38-72) was sent down in Rajab
				A.H. 9 or a little before this, when the Holy Prophet was
				engaged in making preparations for the Campaign of Tabuk.
				In this discourse, the Believers were urged to take
				active part in jihad, and the shirkers were severely
				rebuked for holding back their wealth and for hesitation
				to sacrifice their lives in the way of Allah because of
				their hypocrisy, weak faith or negligence.
			</p>
			<p>
				The third discourse (vv. 73-I 29) was revealed on his
				return from the Campaign of Tabuk. There are some pieces
				in this discourse that were sent down on different
				occasions during the same period and were afterwards
				consolidated by the Holy Prophet into the Surah in
				accordance with inspiration from Allah. But this caused
				no interruption in its continuity because they dealt with
				the same subject and formed part of the same series of
				events. This discourse warns the hypocrites of their evil
				deeds and rebukes those Believers who had stayed behind
				in the Campaign of Tabuk. Then after taking them to task,
				Allah pardons those true Believers who had not taken part
				in the Jihad in the Way of Allah for one reason or the
				other. Chronologically, the first discourse should have
				come last; but being the most important of the three in
				regard to its subject-matter, it was placed first in the
				order of compilation.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Historical Background">
			<p>
				Now let us consider the historical background of the
				Surah. The series of events that have been discussed in
				this Surah took place after the Peace Treaty of
				Hudaibiyah. By that time, one-third of Arabia had come
				under the sway of Islam which had established itself as a
				powerful, well organized and civilized Islamic State.
				This Treaty afforded further opportunities to Islam to
				spread its influence in the comparatively peaceful
				atmosphere created by it. After this Treaty, two events
				took place, which led to very important results:
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Conquest of Arabia">
			<p>
				The first was the Conquest of Arabia. The Holy Prophet
				was able to send missions among different clans for the
				propagation of Islam. The result was that during the
				short period of two years, it became such a great power
				that it made the old order of ignorance feel helpless
				before it. So much so that the zealous elements from
				among the Quraish were so exasperated that they broke the
				Treaty in order to encounter Islam in a decisive combat.
				But the Holy Prophet took prompt action after the breach
				so as not to allow them any opportunity to gather enough
				force for this. He made a sudden invasion on Makkah in
				the month of Ramadan in A H. 8 and conquered it. Though
				this conquest broke the backbone of the order of
				ignorance, it made still another attack on Islam in the
				battlefield of Hunain, which proved to be its
				death-knell. The clans of Hawazin Thaqif, Naur, Jushm and
				others gathered their entire forces in the battlefield in
				order to crush the reformative Revolution, but they
				utterly failed in their evil designs. The defeat of
				'ignorance' at Hunain paved the way for making the whole
				of Arabia the 'Abode of Islam' (Dar-ul-Islam). The result
				was that hardly a year had passed after the Battle of
				Hunain, when the major portion of Arabia came within the
				fold of Islam and only a few upholders of the old order
				remained scattered over some corners of the country.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second event that contributed towards making Islam a
				formidable power was the Campaign of Tabuk, which was
				necessitated by the provocative activities of the
				Christians living within or near the boundaries of the
				Roman Empire to the north of Arabia. Accordingly, the
				Holy Prophet, with an army of thirty thousand marched
				boldly towards the Roman Empire but the Romans evaded the
				encounter. The result was that the power of the Holy
				Prophet and Islam increased manifold and deputation from
				all corners of Arabia began to wait upon him on his
				return from Tabuk in order to offer their allegiance to
				Islam and obedience to him. The Holy Quran has described
				this triumph in Surah An-Nisa: "When the succor of Allah
				came and victory was attained and you saw people entering
				the fold of Islam in large numbers...
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Campaign to Tabuk">
			<p>
				The Campaign to Tabuk was the result of conflict with the
				Roman Empire, that had started even before the conquest
				of Makkah. One of the missions sent after the Treaty of
				Hudaibiyah to different parts of Arabia visited the clans
				which lived in the northern areas adjacent to Syria. The
				majority of these people were Christians, who were under
				the influence of the Roman Empire. Contrary to all the
				principles of the commonly accepted international law,
				they killed fifteen members of the delegation near a
				place known as Zat-u-Talah (or Zat-i-Itlah). Only Ka'ab
				bin Umair Ghifari, the head of the delegation, succeeded
				in escaping and reporting the sad incident. Besides this,
				Shurahbil bin Amr, the Christian governor of Busra, who
				was directly under the Roman Caesar, had also put to
				death Haritli bin Umair, the ambassador of the Holy
				Prophet, who had been sent to him on a similar minion.
			</p>
			<p>
				These events convinced the Holy Prophet that a strong
				action should be taken in order to make the territory
				adjacent to the Roman Empire safe and secure for the
				Muslims. Accordingly, in the month of Jamadi-ul-Ula A.H.
				8, he sent an army of three thousand towards the Syrian
				border. When this army reached near Ma'an, the Muslims
				learnt that Shurahbil was marching with an army of one
				hundred thousand to fight with them and that the Caesar,
				who himself was at Hims, had sent another army consisting
				of one hundred thousand soldiers under his brother
				Theodore. But in spite of such fearful news, the brave
				small band of the Muslims marched on fearlessly and
				encountered the big army of Shurahbil at M'utah. And the
				result of the encounter in which the Muslims were
				fighting against fearful odds (the ratio of the two
				armies was 1:33), was very favorable, for the enemy
				utterly failed to defeat them. This proved very helpful
				for the propagation of Islam. As a result, those Arabs
				who were living in a state of semidependence in Syria and
				near Syria and the clans of Najd near Iraq, who were
				under the influence of the Iranian Empire, turned towards
				Islam and embraced it in thousands. For example, the
				people of Bani Sulaim (whose chief was Abbas bin Mirdas
				Sulaimi), Ashja'a, Ghatafan, Zubyan, Fazarah, etc., came
				into the fold of Islam at the same time. Above all,
				Farvah bin 'Amral Juzami, who was the commander of the
				Arab armies of the Roman Empire, embraced Islam during
				that time, and underwent the trial of his Faith in a way
				that filled the whole territory with wonder. When the
				Caesar came to know that Farvah had embraced Islam, he
				ordered that he should be arrested and brought to his
				court. Then the Caesar said to him, "You will have to
				choose one of the two things. Either give up your Islam
				and win your liberty and your former rank, or remain a
				Muslim and face death." He calmly chose Islam and
				sacrificed his life in the way of the Truth.
			</p>
			<p>
				No wonder that such events as these made the Caesar
				realize the nature of the danger that was threatening his
				Empire from Arabia. Accordingly, in 9 A.H. he began to
				make military preparations to avenge the insult he had
				suffered at M'utah. The Ghassanid and other Arab chiefs
				also began to muster armies under him. When the Holy
				Prophet, who always kept himself well-informed even of
				the minuet things that could affect the Islamic Movement
				favorably or adversely, came to know of these
				preparations, he at once understood their meaning.
				Therefore, without the least hesitation he decided to
				fight against the great power of the Caesar. He knew that
				the show of the slightest weakness would result in the
				utter failure of the Movement which was facing three
				great dangers at that time. First the dying power of
				'ignorance' that had almost been crushed in the
				battlefield of Hunain might revive again. Secondly, the
				Hypocrites of Al-Madinah, who were always on the look-out
				for such an opportunity, might make full use of this to
				do the greatest possible harm to it. For they had already
				made preparations for this and had, through a monk called
				Abu Amir, sent secret messages of their evil designs to
				the Christian king of Ghassan and the Caesar himself.
				Besides this, they had also built a mosque near
				Al-Madinah for holding secret meetings for this purpose.
				The third danger was of an attack by the Caesar himself,
				who had already defeated Iran, the other great power of
				that period, and filled with awe the adjacent
				territories. It is obvious that if all these three
				elements had been given an opportunity of taking a
				concerted action against the Muslims, Islam would have
				lost the fight it had almost won. That is why in this
				case the Holy Prophet made an open declaration for making
				preparations for the Campaign against the Roman Empire,
				which was one of the two greatest empires of the world of
				that period. The declaration was made though all the
				apparent circumstances were against such a decision: for
				there was famine in the country and the long awaited
				crops were about to ripen: the burning heat of the
				scorching summer season of Arabia was at its height and
				there was not enough money for preparations in general,
				and for equipment and conveyance in particular. But in
				spite of these handicaps, when the Messenger of Allah
				realized the urgency of the occasion, he took this step
				which was to decide whether the Mission of the Truth was
				going to survive or perish. The very fact that he made an
				open declaration for making preparations for such a
				campaign to Syria against the Roman Empire showed how
				important it was, for this was contrary to his previous
				practice. Usually he took every precaution not to reveal
				beforehand the direction to which he was going nor the
				name of the enemy whom he was going to attack; nay, he
				did not move out of Al-Madinah even in the direction of
				the campaign.
			</p>
			<p>
				All the parties in Arabia fully realized the grave
				consequences of this critical decision. The remnants of
				the lovers of the old order of 'ignorance' were anxiously
				waiting for the result of the Campaign, for they had
				pinned all their hopes on the defeat of Islam by the
				Romans. The 'hypocrites' also considered it to be their
				last chance of crushing the power of Islam by internal
				rebellion, if the Muslims suffered a defeat in Syria.
				They had, therefore, made full use of the Mosque built by
				them for hatching plots and had employed all their
				devices to render the Campaign a failure. On the other
				side, the true Believers also realized fully that the
				fate of the Movement for which they had been exerting
				their utmost for the last 22 years was now hanging in the
				balance. If they showed courage on that critical
				occasion, the doors of the whole outer world would be
				thrown open for the Movement to spread. But if they
				showed weakness or cowardice, then all the work they had
				done in Arabia would end in smoke. That is why these
				lovers of Islam began to make enthusiastic preparations
				for the Campaign. Everyone of them tried to surpass the
				other in making contributions for the provision of
				equipment for it. Hadrat Uthman and Hadrat Abdur Rehman
				bin Auf presented large sums of money for this purpose.
				Hadrat Umar contributed half of the earnings of his life
				and Hadrat Abu Bakr the entire earnings of his life. The
				indigent Companions did not lag behind and presented
				whatever they could earn by the sweat of their labor and
				the women parted with their ornaments. Thousands of
				volunteers, who were filled with the desire of
				sacrificing their lives for Islam, came to the Holy
				Prophet and requested that arrangements for weapons and
				conveyance be made for them so that they should join the
				expedition. Those who could not be provided with these
				shed tears of sorrow; the scene was so pathetic that it
				made the Holy Prophet sad because of his inability to arm
				them. In short, the occasion became the touchstone for
				discriminating a true believer from a hypocrite. For, to
				lag behind in the Campaign meant that the very
				relationship of a person to Islam was doubtful.
				Accordingly, whenever a person lagged behind during the
				journey to Tabuk, the Holy Prophet, on being informed,
				would spontaneously say, "Leave him alone. If there be
				any good in him, Allah will again join him with you, and
				if there be no good in him, then thank Allah that He
				relieved you of his evil company".
			</p>
			<p>
				In short, the Holy Prophet marched out towards Syria in
				Rajab A.H. 9, with thirty thousand fighters for the cause
				of Islam. The conditions in which the expedition was
				undertaken may be judged from the fact that the number of
				camels with them was so small that many of them were
				obliged to walk on foot and to wait for their turns for
				several had to ride at a time on each camel. To add to
				this, there was the burning heat of the desert and the
				acute shortage of water. But they were richly rewarded
				for their firm resolve and sincere adherence to the cause
				and for their perseverance in the face of those great
				difficulties and obstacles.
			</p>
			<p>
				When they arrived at Tabuk, they learnt that the Caesar
				and his allies had withdrawn their troops from the
				frontier and there was no enemy to fight with. Thus they
				won a moral victory that increased their prestige
				manifold and, that too, without shedding a drop of blood.
				In this connection, it is pertinent to point out that the
				general impression given by the historians of the
				campaigns of the Holy Prophet about the Campaign of Tabuk
				is not correct. They relate the event in a way as if the
				news of the mustering of the Roman armies near the
				Arabian frontier was itself false. The fact is that the
				Caesar had begun to muster his armies, but the Holy
				Prophet forestalled him and arrived on the scene before
				he could make full preparations for the invasion.
				Therefore, believing that "discretion is the better part
				of valor," he withdrew his armies from the frontier. For
				he had not forgotten that the three thousand fighters for
				the cause of Islam had rendered helpless his army one
				hundred thousand strong at M'utah. He could not,
				therefore, even with an army of two hundred thousand,
				dare to fight against an army of thirty thousand, and
				that, too, under the leadership of the Holy Prophet
				himself. When the Holy Prophet found that the Caesar had
				withdrawn his forces from the frontier, he considered the
				question whether it would be worthwhile to march into the
				Syrian territory or to halt at Tabuk and turn his moral
				victory to political and strategic advantage. He decided
				on the latter course and made a halt for twenty days at
				Tabuk. During this time, he brought pressure on the small
				states that lay between the Roman Empire and the Islamic
				State and were at that time under the influence of the
				Romans, and subdued and made them the tributaries of the
				Islamic State. For instance, some Christian chiefs
				Ukaidir bin Abdul Malik Kindi of Dumatul Jaiidal, Yuhanna
				bin D'obah of Ailah, and the chiefs of Maqna, Jarba' and
				Azruh also submitted and agreed to pay Jizyah to the
				Islamic State of Al-Madinah. As a result of this, the
				boundaries of the Islamic State were extended right up to
				the Roman Empire, and the majority of the Arab clans, who
				were being used by the Caesar against Arabia, became the
				allies of the Muslims against the Romans. Above all, this
				moral victory of Tabuk afforded a golden opportunity to
				the Muslims to strengthen their hold on Arabia before
				entering into a long conflict with the Romans. For it
				broke the back of those who had still been expecting that
				the old order of 'ignorance' might revive in the near
				future, whether they were the open upholders of shirk or
				the hypocrites who were hiding their shirk under the garb
				of Islam. The majority of such people were compelled by
				the force of circumstances to enter into the fold of
				Islam and, at least, make it possible for their
				descendants to become true Muslims. After this a mere
				impotent minority of the upholders of the old order was
				left in the field, but it could not stand in the way of
				the Islamic Revolution for the perfection of which Allah
				had sent His Messenger.

		</section>
		<section heading="Problems of the Period">
			<p>
				If we keep in view the preceding background, we can
				easily find out the problems that were confronting the
				Community at that time. They were: (1)to make the whole
				of Arabia a perfect Dar-ul-Islam, (2)to extend the
				influence of Islam to the adjoining
			</p>
			<p>
				countries,
			</p>
			<p>
				(3)to crush the mischiefs of the hypocrites, and (4)to
				prepare the Muslims for Jihad against the non-Muslim
				world.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now that the administration of the whole of Arabia had
				come in the hands of the Believers, and all the opposing
				powers had become helpless, it was necessary to make a
				clear declaration of that policy which was to be adopted
				to make her a perfect Dar-ul-Islam Therefore the
				following measures were adopted.
			</p>
			<p>
				A clear declaration was made that all the treaties with
				the mushriks were abolished and the Muslims would be
				released from the treaty obligations with them after a
				respite of four months.(vv. 1-3). This declaration was
				necessary for uprooting completely the system of life
				based on shirk and to make Arabia exclusively the center
				of Islam so that it should not in any way interfere with
				the spirit of Islam nor become an internal danger for it.
			</p>
			<p>
				A decree was issued that the guardianship of the Kaabah,
				which held central position in all the affairs of Arabia,
				should be wrested from the mushriks and placed
				permanently in the hands of the Believers, (vv. 12-18)
				that all the customs and practices of the shirk of the
				era of 'ignorance' should be forcibly abolished: that the
				mushriks should not be allowed even to come near the
				"House" (v. 28). This was to eradicate every trace of
				shirk from the "House" that was dedicated exclusively to
				the worship of Allah. The evil practice of Nasi, by which
				they used to tamper with the sacred months in the days of
				'ignorance', was forbidden as an act of kufr (v. 37).
				This was also to serve as an example to the Muslims for
				eradicating every vestige of the customs of ignorance
				from the life of Arabia (and afterwards from the lives of
				the Muslims everywhere). In order to enable the Muslims
				to extend the influence of Islam outside Arabia, they
				were enjoined to crush with sword the non-Muslim powers
				and to force them to accept the sovereignty of the
				Islamic State. As the great Roman and Iranian Empires
				were the biggest hindrances in the way, a conflict with
				them was inevitable. The object of Jihad was not to
				coerce them to accept Islam-they were free to accept or
				not to accept it-but to prevent them from thrusting
				forcibly their deviations upon others and the coming
				generations. The Muslims were enjoined to tolerate their
				misguidance only to the extent that they might have the
				freedom to remain misguided, if they chose to be so,
				provided that they paid Jizyah (v. 29) as a sign of their
				subjugation to the Islamic State.
			</p>
			<p>
				The third important problem was to crush the mischiefs of
				the hypocrites, who had hitherto been tolerated in spite
				of their flagrant crimes. Now that there was practically
				no pressure upon them from outside, the Muslims were
				enjoined to treat them openly as disbelievers (v. 73).
				Accordingly, the Holy Prophet set on fire the house of
				Swailim, where the hypocrites used to gather for
				consultations in order to dissuade the people from
				joining the expedition to Tabuk. Likewise on his return
				from Tabuk, he ordered to pull down and burn the 'Mosque'
				that had been built to serve as a cover for the
				hypocrites for hatching plots against the true Believers.
			</p>
			<p>
				In order to prepare the Muslims for Jihad against the
				whole non-Muslim world, it was necessary to cure them
				even of that slight weakness of faith from which they
				were still suffering. For there could be no greater
				internal danger to the Islamic Community than the
				weakness of faith, especially where it was going to
				engage itself single-handed in a conflict with the whole
				non-Muslim world. That is why those people who had lagged
				behind in the Campaign to Tabuk or had shown the least
				negligence were severely taken to task, and were
				considered as hypocrites if they had no plausible excuse
				for not fulfilling that obligation. Moreover, a clear
				declaration was made that in future the sole criterion of
				a Muslim's faith shall be the exertions he makes for the
				uplift of the Word of Allah and the role he plays in the
				conflict between Islam and kufr. Therefore, if anyone
				will show any hesitation in sacrificing his life, money,
				time and energies, his faith shall not be regarded as
				genuine. (vv. 81-96). If the above-mentioned important
				points are kept in view during the study of this Surah,
				it will facilitate the understanding of its contents.
			</p>
		</section>
	</sura>
	<sura num="10">
		<section heading="Name">
			<p>
				The Surah takes its name from V. 98, in which there is a
				reference to Prophet Yunus (Jonah). The name, as usual,
				is symbolical and does not indicate that the Surah deals
				with the story of Prophet Jonah.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				We learn from traditions, and this is supported by the
				contents of the Surah itself, that the whole of this
				Surah was revealed at Makkah. But there are some people
				who are of the opinion, that some of its verses were
				revealed at Al-Madinah. This is, however, a superficial
				view. The continuity of the theme clearly shows that this
				does not comprise isolated verses or discourses that were
				revealed at different times and on different occasions.
				On the contrary, it is, from the beginning to the end, a
				closely connected discourse which must have been revealed
				at one sitting. Besides this, the nature of its theme is
				itself a clear proof that the Surah belongs to the Makkan
				period.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Time of Revelation">
			<p>
				We have no tradition in regard to the time of it's
				revelation, but its subject matter gives clear indication
				that it must have been revealed during the last stage of
				the Holy Prophet's residence at Makkah. For the mode of
				the discourse suggests that at the time of its
				revelation, the antagonism of the opponents of the
				Message had become so intense that they could not
				tolerate even the presence of the Holy Prophet and his
				followers among themselves, and that things had come to
				such a pass as to leave no hope that they would ever
				understand and accept the Message of the Prophet. This
				indicates that the last stage of the Prophet's life among
				the people had come, and the final warning like the one
				in this Surah had to be given. These characteristics of
				the discourse are clear proof that it was revealed during
				the last stage of the Movement at Makkah. Another thing
				that determines more specifically the order of the Surahs
				of the last stage at Makkah is the mention (or absence)
				of some open or covert hint about Hijrat (Emigration)
				from Makkah. As this Surah does not contain any hint
				whatsoever about this, it is a proof that it preceded
				those surahs which contain it. Now that we have specified
				the time of its revelation, there is no need of repeating
				its historical background because that has already been
				stated in Surahs VI and VII.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Subject">
			<p>
				This discourse deals with the invitation to the Message,
				admonition and warning. In the very introductory verses,
				the invitation has been extended like this: "The people
				consider it a strange thing that this Message is being
				conveyed by a human being and charge him with sorcery,
				whereas there is nothing strange in it nor has it any
				connection with sorcery or soothsaying. It simply informs
				you of two realities. First, Allah, Who has created the
				universe and manages it, is, in fact, your Master and
				Lord, and He alone is entitled to your worship. The
				second reality is that after the life in this world,
				there will be another life in the Next World, where you
				shall have to render full account of the life of this
				world and be rewarded or punished according to whether
				you adopted the righteous attitude as required by Him
				after acknowledging Him as your Masters or acted against
				His will. Both of these realities, which the Messenger is
				presenting before you, are 'realities' in themselves
				whether you acknowledge them as such or not. He is
				inviting you to accept these and regulate your lives in
				accordance with them; if you accept these, you will have
				a very blessed end; otherwise join shall meet with evil
				consequences."

	<sura num="11">
		<section heading="Name">
			<p>
				This Surah has been named after Prophet Hud whose story
				has been related in vv. 50-60.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				If we consider its theme deeply, we come to the
				conclusion that it was revealed during the same period as
				Surah Yunus and most probably followed it immediately.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Subject">
			<p>
				The Surah deals with the same subject as Surah Yunus,
				that is, invitation to the Message, admonition and
				warning, with this difference that the warning is
				sterner. This is also supported by a Tradition: It is
				related that after its revelation, once Hadrat Abu Bakr
				said to the Holy Prophet, "Of late I have been noticing
				that you are growing older and older. What is the cause
				of it?" The Holy Prophet replied, "Surah Hud and the like
				Surahs have made me old." This shows that it was a very
				hard time for the Holy Prophet and these stern warnings
				added greatly to his anxieties that were caused by the
				persecution from the Quraish, who were doing their worst
				to crush down the Message of Islam. For it was obvious to
				the Holy Prophet that the last limit of the respite given
				by Allah was approaching nearer and nearer and he was
				afraid lest the term of the respite should expire and his
				people be seized by the torment. The invitation is
				this:Obey the Messenger of Allah; discard shirk, and
				worship Allah and Allah alone: establish the entire
				system of your life on the belief that you shall be
				called to account in the Hereafter.
			</p>
			<p>
				The admonition is this:Remember that those people who put
				their faith in the outward appearance of this worldly
				life and rejected the Message of the Prophets met with
				dire consequences. Therefore you should consider it
				seriously whether you should follow the same way that
				history has proved to be the path to ruin.
			</p>
			<p>
				The warning is this:You should not be deluded by the
				delay in the coming of the punishment: it is because of
				the respite that Allah has granted you by His grace so
				that you might mend your ways: if you do not make use of
				this opportunity, you shall be inflicted with an
				inevitable punishment that will destroy you all except
				the Believers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Instead of addressing the people directly, the Quran has
				used the stories of the people of Noah, Hud, Salih, Lot,
				Shu'aib and Moses to achieve the above mentioned objects.
				What is most prominent in their stories is that when
				Allah passes His judgment on the people, He does not
				spare anyone whatsoever, even if he be the nearest
				relative of the Prophet of the time. Only that one is
				rescued who had believed in the Prophet, and none else,
				not even his own son or wife. More than that: the Faith
				demands from each and every Believer that he should
				totally forget his relationships when that judgment comes
				and remember only the relationship of the Faith. For it
				is against the spirit of Islam to show any regard
				whatsoever for the relationships of blood and race. And
				the Muslims demonstrated these teachings practically in
				the Battle of Badr, four years after the revelation of
				this Surah.
			</p>
		</section>
	</sura>
	<sura num="12">
		<section heading="When and Why Revealed?">
			<p>
				The subject matter of this Surah indicates that it was
				revealed during the last stage of the Holy Prophet's
				residence at Makkah, when the Quraish were considering
				the question of killing or exiling or imprisoning him. At
				that time some of the unbelievers put this question
				(probably at the instigation of the Jews) to test him
				:"Why did the Israelites go to Egypt?" This question was
				asked because they knew that their story was not known to
				the Arabs for there was no mention of it whatever in
				their traditions and the Holy Prophet had never even
				referred to it before. Therefore they expected that he
				would not be able to give any satisfactory answer to this
				question or would first evade it, and afterwards try to
				inquire about it from some Jew, and thus he would be
				totally exposed. But, contrary to their expectations, the
				tables were turned on them, for Allah revealed the whole
				story of Prophet Joseph then and there, and the Holy
				Prophet recited it on the spot. This put the Quraish in a
				very awkward position because it not only foiled their
				scheme but also administered a warning to them by aptly
				applying it to their case, as if to say, "As you are
				behaving towards this Prophet, exactly in the same way
				the brothers of Prophet Joseph behaved towards him; so
				you shall meet with the same end."
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Objects of Revelation">
			<p>
				From the above it is clear that this Surah was sent down
				for two objects: The first object was to give the proof
				of the Prophethood of Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon
				him), and that too, the one demanded by the opponents
				themselves so as to prove conclusively that his knowledge
				was not based on mere hearsay, but was gained through
				Revelation. This aspect has been stated explicitly in its
				introductory verses and explained plainly in its
				concluding portion. The second object was to apply it to
				the Quraish and warn them that ultimately the conflict
				between them and the Holy Prophet would end in his
				victory over them. As they were then persecuting their
				brother, the Holy Prophet, in the same way the brothers
				of Prophet Joseph had treated him. The Quraish were told
				indirectly that they would also fail in their evil
				designs just as the brothers of Prophet Joseph had failed
				in his case, even after casting him into the well. This
				is because none has the power to defeat the Divine will.
				And just as the brothers of Prophet Joseph had to humble
				themselves before him, so one day the Quraish shall have
				to beg forgiveness from their brother whom they were then
				trying to crush down. This, too, has been made quite
				plain in v. 7: "Indeed there are signs in this story of
				Joseph and his brothers for these inquirers from among
				the Quraish."
			</p>
			<p>
				The fact is that by applying this story to the conflict,
				the Quran had made a bold and clear prophecy, which was
				fulfilled literally by the events that happened in the
				succeeding ten years. Hardly two years had passed after
				its revelation, when the Quraish conspired to kill the
				Holy Prophet like the brothers of Prophet Joseph, and he
				had to emigrate from Makkah to Al-Madinah, where he
				gained the same kind of power as Prophet Joseph had
				gained in Egypt. Again, in the end the Quraish had to
				humble themselves before him just like the brothers of
				Prophet Joseph, when they humbly requested, "Show mercy
				to us for Allah rewards richly those who show mercy" (V.
				88), and Prophet Joseph generously forgave them, (though
				he had complete power to wreak vengeance on them,)
				saying, " today no penalty shall be inflicted on you. May
				Allah forgive you:He is the greatest of all those who
				forgive" (V. 92). The same story of mercy was repeated,
				when after the conquest of Makkah, the crestfallen
				Quraish stood meekly before the Holy Prophet, who had
				full power to wreak his vengeance on them for each and
				every cruelty committed by them. But instead, he merely
				asked them, "What treatment do you expect from me now?"
				They replied, "You are a generous brother and the son of
				a generous brother." At this, he very generously forgave
				them, saying, "I will give the same answer to your
				request that Joseph gave to his brothers: today, no
				penalty shall be inflicted on you: you are forgiven."
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Topics of Discussion">
			<p>
				Moreover, the Quran does not relate this story as a mere
				narrative but uses it, as usual, for the propagation of
				the Message in the following ways:
			</p>
			<p>
				Throughout the narrative the Quran has made it clear that
				the Faith of Prophets Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Joseph
				(Allah's peace be upon them all) was the same as that of
				Prophet Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) and they
				invited the people to the same Message to which Muhammad
				(Allah's peace be upon him) was inviting them.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then it places the characters of Prophet Jacob and
				Prophet Joseph side by side with the characters of the
				brothers of Joseph, the members of the trade caravan, the
				court dignitary; Al Aziz of Egypt and his wife, the
				"ladies" of Egypt and the rulers of Egypt and poses a
				silent question to the reader, as if to say, "Contrast
				the former characters molded by Islam on the bedrock of
				the worship of Allah and accountability in the Hereafter
				with the latter molded by kufr and "ignorance" on the
				worship of the world and disregard of Allah and the
				Hereafter, and decide for yourselves which of these two
				patterns you would choose."
			</p>
			<p>
				The Quran has used this story to bring forth another
				truth: whatever Allah wills, He fulfills it anyhow, and
				man can never defeat His plan with his counterplans nor
				prevent it from happening nor change it in any way
				whatever. Nay, it often so happens that man adopts some
				measure to fulfill his own design and believes that he
				has done that very thing which would fulfill his design,
				but in the end he finds to his dismay that he had done
				something which was against his own and conducive to the
				Divine purpose. When the brothers of Prophet Joseph cast
				him into the well, they believed that they had once for
				all got rid of the obstacle in their way but in fact,
				they had paved the way for the Divine purpose of making
				him the ruler of Egypt, before whom they would have to
				humble themselves in the end. Likewise, the wife of Aziz
				had sent Prophet Joseph to the prison, gloating over the
				thought that she had wrought her vengeance on him, but,
				in fact, she had provided for him the opportunity for
				becoming the ruler of Egypt and for putting herself to
				the shame of confessing her own sin publicly.
			</p>
			<p>
				And these are not the solitary instances which prove the
				truth that even if the whole world united to bring about
				the down fall of the one whom Allah willed to raise high,
				it could not succeed. Nay, the very "sure and effective"
				measures that were adopted by the brothers to degrade
				Joseph were used by Allah for the success of Joseph and
				for the humiliation and disgrace of his brothers. On the
				other hand, if Allah willed the fall of one, no measure,
				howsoever effective, could raise him high: nay, it helped
				to bring about his fall and the disgrace of those who
				adopted them.
			</p>
			<p>
				Moreover, the story contains other lessons for those who
				intend to follow the way of Allah. The first lesson it
				teaches is that one should remain within the limits,
				prescribed by the Divine Law, in one's aims and objects
				and measures, for success and failure are entirely in the
				hands of Allah. Therefore if one adopts pure aims and
				lawful measures but fails, at least one will escape
				ignominy and disgrace. On the other hand, the one who
				adopts an impure aim and unlawful measures to achieve it,
				shall not only inevitably meet with ignominy and disgrace
				in the Hereafter, but also runs the risk of ignominy and
				disgrace in this world.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second lesson it teaches is that those who exert for
				the cause of truth and righteousness and put their trust
				in Allah and entrust all their affairs to Him, get
				consolation and comfort from Him, for this helps them
				face their opponents with confidence and courage and they
				do not lose heart, when they encounter the apparently
				terrifying measures of the powerful enemies. They will
				persevere in their task without fear and leave the
				results to Allah.
			</p>
			<p>
				But the greatest lesson this story teaches is that if the
				Believer possesses true Islamic character and is endowed
				with wisdom, he can conquer a whole country with the
				strength of his character alone. The marvelous example of
				Prophet Joseph teaches us that a man of high and pure
				character comes out successful even under the most
				adverse circumstances. When Prophet Joseph went to Egypt,
				he was only a lad of seventeen years, a foreigner, all
				alone and without any provisions; nay, he had been sold
				there as a slave. And the horrible condition of the
				slaves during that period is known to every student of
				history. Then he was charged with a heinous moral crime
				and sent to prison for an indefinite term. But throughout
				this period of affliction, he evinced the highest moral
				qualities which raised him to the highest rank in the
				country.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Historical and Geographical Background">
			<p>
				The following historical and geographical details will
				help understand the story: Prophet Joseph was a son of
				Prophet Jacob and a grandson of Prophet Isaac and a great
				grandson of Prophet Abraham (Allah's peace be upon them
				all). The Bible says (and the allusions in the Quran also
				confirm this) that Prophet Jacob had twelve sons from
				four wives. Prophet Joseph and his younger brother
				Benjamin were from one wife and the other ten from the
				other wives. Prophet Jacob had settled at Hebron
				(Palestine) where his father Prophet Isaac and before him
				Prophet Abraham lived and owned a piece of land at
				Shechem as well.
			</p>
			<p>
				According to the research scholars of the Bible, Prophet
				Joseph was born in or about 906 B. C. and the incident
				with which this story begins happened in or about 890 B.
				C. He was seventeen when he saw the dream and was thrown
				into the well. This well was near Dothan to the north of
				Shechem according to Biblical and Talmudic traditions,
				and the caravan, which took him out of the well, was
				coming from Gilead (Trans-Jordan), and was on its way to
				Egypt. At that time Fifteenth Dynasty ruled over Egypt,
				whose rulers are known in history as the Hyksos kings.
				They belonged to the Arab race, but had migrated from
				Palestine and Syria to Egypt in or about 2000 B.C. and
				taken possession of the country. The Arab historians and
				the commentators of the Quran have given them the name of
				Amaliq (the Amalekites), and this has been corroborated
				by the recent researches made by the Egyptologists. They
				were foreign invaders who had got the opportunity of
				establishing their kingdom because of the internal feuds
				in the country. That is why there was no prejudice in the
				way of Prophet Joseph's ascendancy to power and in the
				subsequent settlement of the Children of Israel in the
				most fertile region of Egypt. They could gain that power
				and influence which they did, because they belonged to
				the same race as the foreign rulers of Egypt.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Hyksos ruled over Egypt up to the end of the
				fifteenth century B.C., and practically all the powers
				remained in the hands of the Israelites. The Quran has
				made a reference to this in v. 20 of Al-Ma'idah: ...He
				raised Prophets among you and made you rulers..., Then
				there arose a great nationalist movement which overthrew
				the power of this dynasty and exiled 250,000 or so of the
				Amalekites. As a result of this, a very bigoted dynasty
				of Copts came into power and uprooted everything
				connected with the Amalekites. Then started that
				persecution of the Israelites which has been mentioned in
				connection with the story of Prophet Moses.
			</p>
			<p>
				We also learn from the history of Egypt that the "Hyksos
				kings" did not acknowledge the gods of Egypt and,
				therefore, had imported their own gods from Syria, with a
				view to spreading their own religion in Egypt. This is
				the reason why the Quran has not called the king who was
				the contemporary of Prophet Joseph by the title of
				"Pharaoh," because this title was associated with the
				religion of the original people of Egypt and the Hyksos
				did not believe in it, but the Bible erroneously calls
				him "Pharaoh". It appears that the editors of the Bible
				had the misunderstanding that all the kings of Egypt were
				"Pharaohs." The modern research scholars who have made a
				comparative study of the Bible and the Egyptian history
				are generally of the opinion that Apophis was the Hyksos
				king, who was the contemporary of Prophet Joseph.
			</p>
			<p>
				At that time Memphis was the capital of Egypt, whose
				ruins are still found on the Nile at a distance of 4
				miles south of Cairo. When Prophet Joseph was taken
				there, he was 17 or 18 years old. He remained in the
				house of Aziz for three years and spent nine years in
				prison, and then became the ruler of the land at the age
				of thirty and ruled over Egypt independently for eighty
				years. In the ninth or tenth year of his rule he sent for
				his father, Prophet Jacob, to come from Palestine to
				Egypt with all the members of his family and, according
				to the Bible, settled them in the land of Goshen, where
				they lived up to the time of Prophet Moses. The Bible
				says that before his death, Prophet Joseph bound his
				kindred by an oath: "when you return from this country to
				the house of your forefathers you must take my bones out
				of this country with you." So he died a hundred and ten
				years old, and they embalmed him.
			</p>
			<p>
				Though the story of Prophet Joseph as given in the Quran
				differs very much in its details from that given in the
				Bible and the Talmud, the Three generally agree in regard
				to its component parts. We shall explain the differences,
				when and where necessary, in our Explanatory Notes.

				This Surah takes its name from the word (ar-Ra'ad)
				(thunder) that occurs in v. 13. It is merely the symbolic
				name of the Surah and does not in any way mean that the
				Surah deals with the scientific problems connected with
				thunder.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				The internal evidence (vv 27-31 and vv. 34-48) shows that
				this Surah was revealed in the last stage of the Mission
				of the Holy Prophet at Makkah and during the same period
				in which Surahs Yunus, Hud and Al-A'araf were sent down.
				The manner of speech indicates that a long time had
				passed since the Holy Prophet had been conveying the
				Message. On the one hand, his opponents had been
				contriving different devices to defeat him and his
				Mission, and, on the other, his followers had been
				expressing a desire that by showing a miracle the
				disbelievers might be brought to the Right Way. In
				answer, Allah impressed on the Believers that it is not
				His way to convert people by this method and that they
				should not lose heart, if He is giving the enemies of the
				Truth a rope long enough to hang themselves. Otherwise,
				He is able to show such signs as may bring the dead out
				of their graves and make them speak (v. 31), but even
				then these obdurate people will invent an excuse to
				explain this away. All this decisive evidence clearly
				proves that this Surah was revealed during the last stage
				of the Prophet's Mission at Makkah.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Central Theme">
			<p>
				The first verse enunciates the main theme of this Surah,
				that is, "The Message of Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon
				him) is the very Truth, but it is the fault of the people
				that they are rejecting it." This is the pivot on which
				the whole Surah turns. This is why it has been shown over
				and over again in different ways that the basic
				components of the Message Tauhid, Resurrection and
				Prophethood are a reality: therefore they should believe
				sincerely in these for their own moral and spiritual
				good. They have been warned that they shall incur their
				own ruin if they reject them, for kufr by itself is sheer
				folly and ignorance. Moreover, the aim of the Surah is
				not merely to satisfy the minds but also to appeal to the
				hearts to accept the Faith. Therefore it does not merely
				put forward logical arguments in support of the truth of
				the Message and against the people's wrong notions, but
				at appropriate intervals it makes frequent use of
				sympathetic and earnest appeals to win over their hearts
				by warning them of the consequences of kufr and by
				holding out the happy rewards of Faith so that the
				foolish people should give up their obduracy.
			</p>
			<p>
				Besides this, the objections of the opponents have been
				answered without any mention of them, and those doubts
				which are proving a hindrance in the way of the Message
				or were being created by the opponents have been removed.
				At the same time, the Believers; who had been passing
				through long and hard ordeal and were feeling tired, and
				waiting anxiously for Allah's succor, have been comforted
				and filled with hope and courage.

				The Surah takes its name from v. 35 in which mention has
				been made of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham). But it does not
				mean that it contains the life story of Prophet Abraham.
				The name is merely a symbol like the names of many other
				surahs, i.e., the Surah in which Abraham's mention has
				been made.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				It appears from the tone of the Surah that it belongs to
				that group of the Surahs which were revealed during the
				last stage of the Makkan period. For instance, v. 13
				("The disbelievers warned their Messengers, 'you shall
				have to return to our community or we will assuredly
				expel you from our land'") clearly indicates that the
				persecution of the Muslims was at its worst at the time
				of the revelation of this Surah, and the people of Makkah
				were bent on expelling the Believers from there like the
				disbelievers of the former Prophets. That is why in v. 14
				they have been warned, "We will destroy these evil
				doers," and the Believers have been comforted as were the
				believers before them, "and after them settle you in the
				land" Likewise the stern warning contained in the
				concluding portion (vv. 43-52 also confirms that the
				Surah relates to the last stage of the Makkan Period.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Central Theme and Purpose">
			<p>
				This Surah is an admonition and a warning to the
				disbelievers who were rejecting the Message of the Holy
				Prophet and devising cunning schemes to defeat his
				Mission. But warning, reproof, censure and reproach
				dominate admonition. This is because a good deal of
				admonition had already been made in the preceding Surahs,
				but in spite of this their obduracy, enmity, antagonism,
				mischief, persecution etc. had rather increased.

				It is clear from its topics and style that the period of
				its revelation is about the same as that of Surah
				Ibrahim, for two things are quite prominent in its
				background. First, it appears from the repeated warnings
				in this Surah that in spite of the fact that the Holy
				Prophet had been propagating the Message for many years,
				his people in general had not shown any inclination
				towards its acceptance; nay, they had become more and
				more obdurate and stubborn in their antagonism, enmity
				and ridicule with the passage of time. Secondly, by that
				time the Holy Prophet had begun to feel a little tired of
				making strenuous efforts to eradicate disbelief and
				opposition of his people. That is why Allah has consoled
				and comforted him over and over again by way of
				encouragement.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Topics and the Central Theme">

				it does not mean that this Surah does not contain

				The following internal evidence shows that this Surah was

			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					v. 41 clearly shows that persecution had forced

					revelation of this Surah.
				</li>
				<li>
					It is evident from v. 106 that at that time the
					persecution of the Muslims was at its height.
					Therefore a problem had arisen in regard to the
					utterance of a blasphemous word, without actual
					disbelief, under unbearable conditions. The
					problem was that if one did so how he should be
					treated.
				</li>
				<li>

					seven-year famine that had struck Makkah some
					years after the appointment of the Holy Prophet
					as Allah's Messenger.

				<li>
					There is a reference to v. 116 of this Surah in
					v. 145, and v. 118 of this Surah contains a

		<section heading="Central Theme">
			<p>
				All the topics of the Surah revolve round different
				aspects of the Message, i.e., refutation of shirk, proof
				of Tauhid, and warning of the consequences of the
				rejection of and opposition and antagonism to the
				Message.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Topics of Discussion">
			<p>
				The very first verse gives direct and strict warning to
				those who were rejecting the Message outright, as if to
				say, "Allah's decision has already been made concerning
				your rejection of the Message. Why are you then clamoring
				for hastening it? Why don't you make use of the respite
				that is being given to you!" And this was exactly what
				the disbelievers of Makkah needed at the time of the
				revelation of this Surah. For they challenged the Holy
				Prophet over and over again: "Why don't you bring that
				scourge with which you have been threatening us! For we
				have not only rejected your Message but have been openly
				opposing it for a long time." Such a challenge had become
				a by-word with them, which they frequently repeated as a
				clear proof that Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) was
				not a true Prophet.
			</p>
			<p>
				Immediately after this warning they have been admonished
				to give up shirk, for this false creed was the main
				obstacle in the way of the Message. Then the following
				topics come over and over again, one after the other:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Very convincing proofs of Tauhid and refutation
					of shirk have been based on the plain signs in
					the universe and in man's own self.
				</li>
				<li>
					The objections of the disbelievers have been
					answered, their arguments refuted, their doubts
					removed and their false pretexts exposed.
				</li>
				<li>
					Warnings have given of the consequences of
					persistence in false ways and antagonism to the
					Message.
				</li>
				<li>
					The moral changes which the Message of the Holy
					Prophet aims to bring practically in human life
					have been presented briefly in an appealing
					manner. The mushriks have been told that belief
					in Allah, which they also professed, demanded
					that it should not be confined merely to lip
					service, but this creed should take a definite
					shape in moral and practical life.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				The Holy Prophet and his companions have been comforted
				and told about the attitude they should adopt in the face
				of antagonism and persecution by the disbelievers.

				the last stage of Prophethood at Makkah.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Background">
			<p>
				The Holy Prophet had been propagating Tauhid for the
				previous twelve years and his opponents had been doing
				all they could to make his Mission a failure, but in
				spite of all their opposition, Islam had spread to every
				corner of Arabia and there was hardly any clan which had
				not been influenced by his invitation. In Makkah itself
				the true Believers had formed themselves into a small
				community and were ready and willing to face every danger
				to make Islam a success. Besides them, a very large
				number of the people of Aus and Khazraj (two influential
				clans of Al- Madinah) had accepted Islam. Thus the time
				had come for the Holy Prophet to emigrate from Makkah to
				Al-Madinah and there gather together the scattered
				Muslims and establish a state based on the principles of
				Islam. These were the conditions when Miraj took place
				and on his return the Holy Prophet brought down the
				Message contained in this Surah.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Topics">
			<p>
				This Surah is a wonderful combination of warning,
				admonition and instruction, which have been blended
				together in a balanced proportion. The disbelievers of
				Makkah had been admonished to take a lesson from the
				miserable end of the Israelites and other communities and
				mend their ways within the period of respite given by
				Allah, which was about to expire. They should, therefore,
				accept the invitation that was being extended by Muhammad
				(Allah's peace be upon him) and the Quran; otherwise they
				shall be annihilated and replaced by other people.
				Incidentally, the Israelites, with whom Islam was going
				to come in direct contact in the near future at
				Al-Madinah have also been warned that they should learn a
				lesson from the chastisements that have already been
				inflicted on them. They were warned, "Take advantage of
				the Prophethood of Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him)
				because that is the last opportunity which is being given
				to you. If even now you behave as you have been behaving,
				you shall meet with a painful torment."
			</p>
			<p>
				As regards the education of mankind, it has been
				impressed that human success or failure, gain or loss,
				depends upon the right understanding of Tauhid
				life-after-death and Prophethood. Accordingly, convincing
				arguments have been put forward to prove that the Quran
				is the Book of Allah and its teachings are true and
				genuine, the doubts of the disbelievers about these basic
				realities have been removed and on suitable occasions
				they have been admonished and rebuked in regard to their
				ways of ignorance.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this connection, those fundamental principles of
				morality and civilization on which the Islamic System of
				life is meant to be established have been put forward.
				Thus this was a sort of the Manifesto of the intended
				Islamic state which had been proclaimed a year before its
				actual establishment. It has been explicitly stated that
				that was the sketch of the system on which Muhammad
				(Allah's peace be upon him) intended to build human life
				first in his own country and then in the outside world.
			</p>
			<p>
				Besides these, the Holy Prophet has been instructed to
				stick firmly to his stand without minding the opposition
				and difficulties which he was encountering and should
				never think of making a compromise with unbelief. The
				Muslims who sometimes showed signs of impatience, when
				they met with persecution, calumny, and crooked
				arguments, have also been instructed to face adverse
				circumstances with patience and fortitude and keep full
				control over their feelings and passions. Moreover, salat
				was prescribed in order to reform and purify their souls,
				as if to say, "This is the thing which will produce in
				you those high qualities of character which are essential
				for everyone who intends to struggle in the righteous
				way." Incidentally, we learn from Traditions that Miraj
				was the first occasion on which the five daily Prayers
				were prescribed to be offered at fixed times.

		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				This is the first of those Surahs which were sent down in
				the third stage of Prophethood at Makkah. We have already
				divided the life of the Holy Prophet at Makkah into four
				stages in the Introduction to Chapter 6. According to
				that division the third stage lasted from the fifth to
				the tenth year of Prophethood. What distinguishes this
				stage from the second and the fourth stages is this.
				During the second stage the Quraish mainly resorted to
				ridiculing, scoffing, threatening, tempting, raising
				objections and making false propaganda against the Holy
				Prophet and his followers in order to suppress the
				Islamic Movement. But during the third stage they
				employed the weapons of persecution, manhandling and
				economic pressure for the same purpose. So much so that a
				large number of the Muslims had to emigrate from Arabia
				to Habash, and those who remained behind were besieged in
				Shi'ib Abi Talib along with the Holy Prophet and his
				family. To add to their misery, a complete social and
				economic boycott was applied against them. The only
				redeeming feature was that there were two personalities,
				Abu Talib and Hadrat Khadijah, whose personal influence
				had been conducive to the support of two great families
				of the Quraish. However, when in the tenth year of
				Prophethood these two persons died, the fourth stage
				began with such revere persecutions as forced the Holy
				Prophet and all his Companions to emigrate from Makkah.
			</p>
			<p>
				It appears from the theme of the Surah that it was
				revealed at the beginning of the third stage when in
				spite of persecutions and opposition, migration to Habash
				had not yet taken place. That is why the story of
				"Ashab-i-Kahf" (the Sleepers of the Cave) has been
				related to comfort and encourage the persecuted Muslims
				and to show them how the righteous people have been
				saving their Faith in the past.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Subject and Topics">
			<p>
				This Surah was sent down in answer to the three questions
				which the mushriks of Makkah, in consultation with the
				people of the Book, had put to the Holy Prophet in order
				to test him. These were: 
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Who were "the Sleepers of the Cave"? 
				</li>
				<li>
					What is the real story of Khidr? 
				</li>
				<li>
					What do you know about Zul- Qarnain?
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				As these three questions and the stories involved
				concerned the history of the Christians and the Jews, and
				were unknown in Hijaz, a choice of these was made to test
				whether the Holy Prophet possessed any source of the
				knowledge of the hidden and unseen things. Allah,
				however, not only gave a complete answer to their
				questions but also employed the three stories to the
				disadvantage of the opponents of Islam in the conflict
				that was going on at that time at Makkah between Islam
				and unbelief.
			</p>
			<p>
				The questioners were told that "the Sleepers of the Cave"
				believed in the same doctrine of Tauhid which was being
				put forward in the Quran and that their condition was
				similar to the condition of the persecuted Muslims of
				Makkah. On the other hand, the persecutors of the
				Sleepers of the Cave had behaved in the same way towards
				them as the disbelievers of the Quraish were behaving
				towards the Muslims. Besides this, the Muslims have been
				taught that even if a Believer is persecuted by a cruel
				society, he should not bow down before falsehood but
				emigrate from the place all alone, if need be, with trust
				in God. Incidentally the disbelievers of Makkah were told
				that the story of the Sleepers of the Cave was a clear
				proof of the creed of the Hereafter, for this showed that
				Allah has the power to resurrect anyone He wills even
				after a long sleep of death as He did in case of the
				Sleepers of the Cave.
			</p>
			<p>
				The story of the Sleepers of the Cave has also been used
				to warn the chiefs of Makkah who were persecuting the
				small newly formed Muslim Community. At the same time,
				the Holy Prophet has been instructed that he should in no
				case make a compromise with their persecutors nor should
				he consider them to be more important than his poor
				followers. On the other hand, those chiefs have been
				admonished that they should not be puffed up with the
				transitory life of pleasure they were then enjoying but
				should seek after those excellence which are permanent
				and eternal.
			</p>
			<p>
				The story of Khidr and Moses has been related in such a
				way as to supply the answer to the question of the
				disbelievers and to give comfort to the Believers as
				well. The lesson contained in this story is this: You
				should have full faith in the wisdom of what is happening
				in the Divine Factory in accordance with the will of
				Allah. As the reality is hidden from you, you are at a
				loss to understand the wisdom of what is happening, and
				sometimes if it appears that things are going against
				you, you cry out, "How and why has this happened?". The
				fact is that if the curtain be removed from the "unseen",
				you would yourselves come to know that what is happening
				here is for the best. Even if sometimes it appears that
				something is going against you, you will see that in the
				end it also produces some good results for you.
			</p>
			<p>
				The same is true of the story of zul-Qarnain for it also
				admonishes the questioners, as if to say, "O you vain
				chiefs of Makkah you should learn a lesson from
				zul-Qarnain. Though he was a great ruler, a great
				conqueror and the owner of great resources, yet he always
				surrendered to his Creator, whereas you are rebelling
				against Him even though you are insignificant chieftains
				in comparison with him. Besides this, though zul-Qarnain
				built one of the strongest walls for protection, yet his
				real trust was in Allah and not in the 'wall'. He
				believed that the wall could protect him against his
				enemies as long as it was the will of Allah and that
				there would be cracks and holes in it, when it would be
				His will; whereas you who possess only insignificant
				fortified abodes and dwellings in comparison with him,
				consider yourselves to be permanently safe and secure
				against all sorts of calamities."
			</p>
			<p>
				While the Quran turned the tables on the questioners who
				had tried to "expose" the Holy Prophet, in the end of the
				Surah the same things have been reiterated that were
				stated at its beginning: "Tauhid and the Hereafter are
				absolutely true and real and for your own good you should
				accept these doctrines, mend your ways in accordance with
				them and live in this world with this conviction that you
				are accountable to Allah: otherwise you shall ruin your
				life and all your doings shall be set at naught."

			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				It was revealed before the Migration to Habash. We learn
				from authentic Traditions that Hadrat Ja'afar recited vv.
				1-40 of this Surah in the court of Negus when he called
				the migrants to his court.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Historical Background">
			<p>
				We have already briefly referred to the conditions of
				that period in the introduction to Surah Al-Kahf. Here we
				shall give rather fuller details of the same conditions,
				which will be helpful in grasping the meaning of this
				Surah and the other Surahs of the period. When the chiefs
				of the Quraish felt that they had failed to suppress the
				Islamic movement by ridicule, sarcasm, and by holding out
				promises and threats and by making false accusations,
				they resorted to persecution, beating and economic
				pressure. They would catch hold of the new Muslims of
				their clans and persecute them, starve them and would
				even inflict physical torture on them in order to coerce
				them to give up Islam. The most pitiful victims of their
				persecution were the poor people and the slaves and the
				proteges of the Quraish. They were beaten black and blue,
				were imprisoned and kept thirsty and hungry and were
				dragged on the burning sands of Makkah. The people would
				get work from the professional laborers but would not pay
				them their wages. As an instance we give below the story
				of Hadrat Khabbab bin Arat, which is given in Bukhari and
				Muslim: "I used to work as a blacksmith in Makkah. Once I
				did some work for As bin Wa'il. When I went to ask for my
				wages, he said, 'I will not pay your wages unless you
				disown Muhammad'."
			</p>
			<p>
				In the same connection Hadrat Khabbab says, "One day the
				Holy Prophet was sitting in the shadow of the Kaabah. I
				went to him and said, 'O Messenger of Allah, now
				persecution has gone to its extreme; why do you not pray
				to Allah (for relief)?' At this the Holy Prophet was
				greatly moved. He said, 'The believers before you were
				persecuted much more than you. Their bones were scraped
				with combs of iron and their heads were cut with saws,
				but still they did not give up their Faith. I assure you
				that Allah will fulfill this Mission, and there will come
				a period of such peace that one would travel from Sanna
				to Hadramaut, and he will have no fear from anyone, save
				Allah. But you people have already become impatient'."
				(Bukhari)
			</p>
			<p>
				When the conditions became unbearable, the Holy Prophet,
				in the month of Rajab of the fifth year of Prophethood,
				gave advice to his Companions to this effect: "You may
				well migrate to Habash, for there is a king, who does not
				allow any kind of injustice to anyone, and there is good
				in his land. You should remain there till the time that
				Allah provides a remedy for your affliction".
			</p>
			<p>
				Accordingly, at first, eleven men and four women left for
				Habash. The Quraish pursued them up to the coast but
				fortunately they got a timely boat for Habash at the
				sea-port of Shu'aibah, and they escaped arrest. Then
				after a few months, other people migrated to Habash and
				their number rose to eighty-three men and eleven women of
				the Quraish and seven non-Quraish. After this, only forty
				persons were left with the Holy Prophet at Makkah.
			</p>
			<p>
				There was a great hue and cry in Makkah after this
				Migration, for every family of the Quraish was adversely
				affected by this. There was hardly a family of the
				Quraish which did not lose a son, a son-in-law, a
				daughter, a brother or a sister. For instance, there were
				among the Migrants the near relatives of Abu Jahl, Abu
				Sufyan and other chief of the Quraish who were notorious
				for their persecution of the Muslims. As a result of
				this, some of them became even more bitter in their
				enmity of Islam, while there were others who were so
				moved by this that they embraced Islam. For instance,
				this Migration left a deep mark on Hadrat Umar. One of
				his relatives, Laila, daughter of Hathmah, says, "I was
				packing my luggage for Migration, while my husband, Amr
				bin Rabiy'ah, had gone out. In the meantime Umar came
				there and began to watch me, while I was engaged in
				preparation for the journey. Then he said, 'Are you also
				going to migrate?' I answered, 'Yes by God, you people
				have persecuted us much. But the wide earth of Allah is
				open for us. Now we are going to a place where Allah will
				grant us peace'. At this, I noticed such signs of emotion
				on the face of Umar as I had never seen before. He simply
				said, 'May God be with you' and went away."
			</p>
			<p>
				After the migration, the Quraish held consultations, and
				decided to send Abdullah bin Abi Rabiy'ah, half brother
				of Abu Jahl, and Amr bin As to Habash with precious gifts
				so as to persuade Negus to send the migrants back to
				Makkah. Hadrat Umm Salmah (a wife of the Holy Prophet),
				who was among the migrants, has related this part of the
				story in detail. She says, "When these two clever
				statesmen of the Quraish reached Habash, they distributed
				the gifts among the courtiers of the King and persuaded
				them to recommend strongly to him to send the migrants
				back. Then they saw Negus himself and, presenting rich
				gifts to him, said, 'Some headstrong brats of our city
				have come to your land and our chiefs have sent us to you
				with the request that you may kindly send them back.
				These brats have forsaken our faith and have not embraced
				your faith either, but have invented a new faith'. As
				soon as they had finished their speech, all the courtiers
				recommended their case, saying, 'We should send such
				people back to their city for their people know them
				better. It is not proper for us to keep them here'. At
				this the King was annoyed and said, 'I am not going to
				give them back without proper inquiry. As these people
				have put their trust in my country rather than in any
				other country and have come here to take shelter, I will
				not betray them. At first I will send for them and
				investigate into the allegations these people have made
				against them. Then I will make my final decision'.
				Accordingly, the King sent for the Companions of the Holy
				Prophet and asked them to come to his court.
			</p>
			<p>
				When the migrants received the message of the King, they
				assembled and held consultations as to what they should
				say to the King. At last they came to this unanimous
				decision: '"We will present before the King the teachings
				of the Holy Prophet without adding anything to or
				withholding anything from them and leave it to him
				whether he lets us remain here or turns us out of his
				country'. When they came to the court, the King put this
				problem abruptly before them: 'I understand that you have
				given up the faith of your own people and have neither
				embraced my faith nor any other existing faith. I would
				like to know what your new faith is.' At this, Jafar bin
				Abi Talib, on behalf of the migrants, made an extempore
				speech to this effect: 'O King! We were sunk deep in
				ignorance and had become very corrupt; then Muhammad
				(Allah's peace be upon him) came to us as a Messenger of
				God, and did his best to reform us. But the Quraish began
				to persecute his followers, so we have come to your
				country in the hope that here we will be free from
				persecution'. After his speech, the King said, 'Please
				recite a piece of the Revelation which has been sent down
				by God to your Prophet'. In response, Hadrat Jafar
				recited that portion of Surah Maryam which relates the
				story of Prophets John and Jesus (Allah's peace be upon
				them). The King listened to it and wept, so much so that
				his beard became wet with tears. When Hadrat Jafar
				finished the recital, he said: 'Most surely this
				Revelation and the Message of Jesus have come from the
				same source. By God I will not give you up into the hands
				of these people'.
			</p>
			<p>
				Next day Amr bin As went to Negus and said, 'Please send
				for them again and ask them concerning the creed they
				hold about Jesus, the son of Mary, for they say a
				horrible thing about him'. The King again sent for the
				migrants, who had already learnt about the scheme of Amr.
				They again sat together and held consultations in regard
				to the answer they should give to the King, if he asked
				about the belief they held about Prophet Jesus. Though
				this was a very critical situation and all of them were
				uneasy about it, they decided that they would say the
				same thing that Allah and His Messenger had taught them.
				Accordingly, when they went to the court, the King put
				them the question that had been suggested by Amr bin As.
				So Jafar bin Abi Talib stood up and answered without the
				least hesitation: 'He was a Servant of Allah and His
				Messenger. He was a Spirit and a Word of Allah which had
				been sent to virgin Mary.' At this the King picked up a
				straw from the ground and said, 'By God, Jesus was not
				worth this straw more than what you have said about him.'
				After this the King returned the gifts sent by the
				Quraish, saying, 'I do not take any bribe'. Then he said
				to the migrants, 'You are allowed to stay here in perfect
				peace'."
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject">
			<p>
				Keeping in view this historical background, it becomes
				quite obvious that this Surah was sent down to serve the
				migrants as a "provision" for their journey to Habash, as
				if to say, "Though you are leaving your country as
				persecuted emigrants to a Christian country, you should
				not in the least hide anything from the teachings you
				have received. Therefore you should plainly say to the
				Christians that Prophet Jesus was not the son of God."
			</p>
			<p>
				After relating the story of Prophets John and Jesus in
				vv. 1-40, the story of Prophet Abraham has been related
				(vv. 41-50) also for the benefit of the Migrants for he
				also had been forced like them to leave his country by
				the persecution of his father, his family and his
				countrymen. On the one hand, this meant to console the
				Emigrants that they were following the footsteps of
				Prophet Abraham and would attain the same good end as
				that Prophet did. On the other hand, it meant to warn the
				disbelievers of Makkah that they should note it well that
				they were in the position of the cruel people who had
				persecuted their forefather and leader, Abraham, while
				the Muslim Emigrants were in the position of Prophet
				Abraham himself.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then the mention of the other Prophets has been made in
				vv. 51-65 with a view to impress that Muhammad (Allah's
				peace be upon him) had brought the same way of Life that
				had been brought by the former Prophets but their
				followers had become corrupt and adopted wrong ways.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the concluding passage (vv. 66-98), a strong criticism
				has been made of the evil ways of the disbelievers of
				Makkah, while the Believers have been given the good news
				that they would come out successful and become the
				beloved of the people, in spite of the worst efforts of
				the enemies of the Truth.

				This Surah takes its name from its first word: "Ta Ha".
				This name, like the names of many other Surahs, is merely
				symbolic.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				The period of its revelation is the same as of Surah
				Maryam. It is just possible that it was sent down during
				the Migration to Habash or just after it. Anyhow, it is
				certain that this Surah was revealed before Hadrat Umar
				embraced Islam.
			</p>
			<p>
				According to a well known and authentic tradition when
				Hadrat Umar set out to kill the Holy Prophet, he met a
				certain person, who said, "Before you do anything else,
				you should know that your own sister and brother-in-law
				have embraced Islam." Hearing this, he directly went to
				the house of his sister. There he found his sister,
				Fatimah, and his brother-in-law, Said bin Zaid, learning
				the contents of a scroll from Khabbab bin Art. When
				Fatimah saw him coming she hid the scroll at once, but
				Hadrat Umar had heard the recital, so he began to
				interrogate them about it. Then he began to thrash his
				brother-in-law, and wounded his sister, who tried to
				protect him. At last both of them confessed, "We have
				become Muslims; you may do whatever you like." As Hadrat
				Umar was moved to see blood running down from her head,
				he said, "Show me the thing you were reading." The sister
				asked him to promise on oath that he would not tear it,
				and added, "You cannot touch it unless you have a bath."
				Accordingly, Hadrat Umar took his bath and when he began
				to read the scroll, which contained this Surah, he
				spontaneously spoke out, "What an excellent thing!" At
				this Hadrat Khabbab, who had hidden himself at the sound
				of his footsteps, came out of his hiding and said, "By
				God, I have high expectations that Allah will get great
				service from you to propagate the Message of His Prophet,
				for just yesterday I heard the Holy Prophet praying to
				Allah, 'My Lord, make Abul Hakam bin Hisham (Abu Jahl) or
				Umar bin Khattab a supporter of Islam'. So O Umar, turn
				to Allah, turn to Allah." These words proved to be so
				persuasive that he at once accompanied Hadrat Khabbab and
				went to the Holy Prophet to embrace Islam. This happened
				a short time after the Migration to Habash.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Topics of Discussion">
			<p>
				This Surah begins with the enunciation of the object of
				the Revelation of the Quran to this effect:"O Muhammad,
				this Quran has not been sent down to you to put you
				unnecessarily to some great affliction. It does not
				demand from you to perform the impossible task of imbuing
				the hearts of the obdurate disbelievers with Faith. It is
				merely an admonition meant to guide on to the Right Path
				those who fear God and want to save themselves from His
				punishment. This Quran is the Word of the Master of the
				earth and the heavens and God-head belongs to Him alone:
				These two facts are eternal whether one believes them or
				not."
			</p>
			<p>
				After this introduction, the Surah abruptly moves on to
				relate the story of Prophet Moses without any apparent
				relevancy and without even hinting at its applicability
				to the events of the period. However, if we read between
				the lines, we realize that the discourse is addressed
				very relevantly to the people of Makkah. But before we
				explain the hidden meaning of the discourse, we must keep
				in view the fact that the Arabs in general acknowledged
				Moses as a Prophet of God. This was so because they had
				"been influenced by the large number of the Jews around
				them and by" the neighbouring Christian kingdoms. Now let
				us state those things which are hidden between the lines
				of the story:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Allah does not appoint a Prophet by the beat of
					drums or by celebrating the occasion in a regular
					and formal ceremony, as if to say, "We are
					appointing such and such a person as Our Prophet
					from today." On the contrary, He bestows
					Prophethood in a confidential manner just as He
					did in the case of Prophet Moses. Therefore you
					should not consider it strange if Hadrat Muhammad
					has been appointed as a Prophet all of a sudden
					and without any public proclamation.
				</li>
				<li>
					The fundamental principles presented by Prophet
					Muhammad Tauhid and the Hereafter are just the
					same as were taught to Prophet Moses at the time
					of his appointment.
				</li>
				<li>
					Prophet Muhammad has been made the standard
					bearer of the Message of the Truth among the
					people of the Quraish all by himself without
					material provisions, just as Prophet Moses was
					entrusted with the Mission to go to a tyrant king
					like Pharaoh and ask him to give up his attitude
					of rebellion. These are the mysterious ways of
					Allah. He catches hold of a wayfarer of Midian on
					his way to Egypt and says, "Go and fight with the
					greatest tyrant of the time." He did not provide
					him with armies and provisions for this Mission.
					The only thing He did was to appoint his brother
					as his assistant at his request.
				</li>
				<li>
					You, O People of Makkah, should note it well that
					Pharaoh employed the same devices against Prophet
					Moses as you are employing against Prophet
					Muhammad; frivolous objections, accusations, and
					cruel persecutions. You should know that Allah's
					Prophet came out victorious over Pharaoh, who
					possessed large armies and war equipment.
					Incidentally, the Muslims have been consoled and
					comforted, though not in so many words, that they
					should not be afraid of fighting with the Quraish
					against fearful odds, for the mission which is
					supported by Allah comes out victorious in the
					end. At the same time, the Muslims have been
					exhorted to follow the excellent example of the
					magicians of Egypt, who remained steadfast in
					their Faith, though Pharaoh threatened them with
					horrible vengeance.
				</li>
				<li>
					An incident from the story of the Israelites has
					been cited to show in what ridiculous manner the
					idolization of false gods and goddesses starts
					and that the Prophets of God do not tolerate even
					the slightest tinge of this preposterous
					practice. Likewise, Prophet Muhammad is following
					the former Prophets in opposing shirk and idol
					worship today.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Thus, the story of Moses has been used to throw light on
				all those matters which were connected with the conflict
				between the Holy Prophet and the Quraish. Then at the end
				of the story, the Quraish have been briefly admonished,
				as if to say, "The Quran has been sent down in your
				tongue for your own good. If you listen to it and follow
				its admonition, you will be doing so for your own good
				but if you reject it, you will yourselves meet with an
				evil end."
			</p>
			<p>
				After this the story of Prophet Adam has been related, as
				if to tell the Quraish, "The way you are following is the
				way of Satan, whereas the right way for a man is to
				follow his father Adam. He was beguiled by Satan, but
				when he realized his error, he plainly confessed it and
				repented and again turned back to the service of Allah
				and won His favor. On the other hand, if a person follows
				Satan and sticks to his error obdurately in spite of
				admonition, he does harm to himself alone like Satan."
			</p>
			<p>
				In the end, the Holy Prophet and the Muslims have been
				advised not to be impatient in regard to the punishment
				to the disbelievers, as if to say, "Allah has His Own
				scheme concerning them. He does not seize them at once
				but gives them sufficient respite. Therefore you should
				not grow impatient but bear the persecutions with
				fortitude and go on conveying the Message."
			</p>
			<p>
				In this connection, great emphasis has been laid on salat
				so that it may create in the believers the virtues of
				patience, forbearance, contentment, resignation to the
				will of God and self analysis for these are greatly
				needed in the service of the Message of the Truth.

		</section>
		<section heading="Subject and Topics">
			<p>
				This Surah discusses the conflict between the Holy
				Prophet and the chiefs of Makkah, which was rampant at
				the time of its Revelation and answers those objections
				and doubts which were being put forward concerning his
				Prophethood and the Doctrines of Tauhid and the
				Hereafter. The chiefs of Makkah have also been rebuked
				for their machinations against the Holy Prophet and
				warned of the evil consequences of their wicked
				activities. They have been admonished to give up their
				indifference and heedlessness that they were showing
				about the Message. At the end of the Surah, they have
				been told that the person whom they considered to be a
				"distress and affliction" had in reality come to them as
				a blessing.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Main Themes">
			<p>
				In vv. 1-47, the following themes have been discussed in
				particular: 
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					The objection of the disbelievers that a human
					being could not be a Messenger and therefore they
					could not accept Muhammad (peace be upon him) as
					a Prophet, has been refuted.
				</li>
				<li>
					They have been taken to task for raising
					multifarious and contradictory objections against
					the Holy Prophet and the Quran.
				</li>
				<li>
					Their wrong conception of life has been proved to
					be false because it was responsible for their
					indifferent and heedless attitude towards the
					Message of the Holy Prophet. They believed that
					life was merely a sport and pastime and had no
					purpose behind or before it and there was no
					accountability or reward or punishment.
				</li>
				<li>
					The main cause of the conflict between the
					disbelievers and the Holy Prophet was their
					insistence on the doctrine of shirk and
					antagonism to the Doctrine of Tauhid So the
					doctrine of shirk has been refuted and the
					Doctrine of Tauhid reinforced by weighty and
					impressive though brief arguments.
				</li>
				<li>
					Arguments and admonitions have been used to
					remove another misunderstanding of theirs. They
					presumed that Muhammad (peace be upon him) was a
					false prophet and his warnings of a scourge from
					God were empty threats, just because no scourge
					was visiting them in spite of their persistent
					rejection of the Prophet. In vv. 48-91, instances
					have been cited from the important events of the
					life stories of the Prophets to show that all the
					Prophets, who were sent by God, were human beings
					and had all the characteristics of a man except
					those which were exclusive to Prophethood. They
					had no share in Godhead and they had to implore
					Allah to fulfill each and every necessity of
					theirs. 
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Along with these two other things have also been
				mentioned:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					All the Prophets had to pass through distress and
					affliction; their opponents did their worst to
					thwart their mission, but in spite of it they
					came out successful by the extraordinary succor
					from Allah.
				</li>
				<li>
					All the Prophets had one and the same "way of
					life', the same as was being presented by
					Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him), and that
					was the only Right Way of Life and all other ways
					invented and introduced by mischievous people
					were utterly wrong.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				In vv. 92-106, it has been declared that only those who
				follow the Right Way, will come out successful in the
				final judgment of God and those who discard it shall meet
				with the worst consequences. In vv. 107-112, the people
				have been told that it is a great favor of Allah that He
				has sent His Messenger to inform them beforehand of this
				Reality and that those, who consider his coming to be an
				affliction instead of a blessing, are foolish people.

			<p>
				This Surah takes its name from v. 27.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				As this Surah contains the characteristics of both the
				Makki and the Madani Surahs, the commentators have
				differed as to its period of revelation, but in the light
				of its style and themes we are of the opinion that a part
				of it (vv. 1-24) was sent down in the last stage of the
				Makki life of the Holy Prophet a little before migration
				and the rest (vv. 25-78) during the first stage of his
				Madani life. That is why this Surah combines the
				characteristics of both the Makki and the Madani Surahs.
			</p>
			<p>
				The sudden change of the style from v. 25 shows that
				probably vv. 25-78 were sent down in the month of
				Zul-Hijjah in the very first year after Hijrah This is
				indicated by vv. 25-41 and confirmed by the occasion of
				the revelation of vv. 39-40. It appears that the month of
				Zul-Hijjah must have brought to the immigrants nostalgic
				memories of their homes in Makkah and naturally they must
				have thought of their Sacred City and of their Hajj
				congregation there, and grieved to think that the mushrik
				Quraish had debarred them from visiting the Sacred
				Mosque. Therefore, they might even have been praying for
				and expecting Divine permission to wage war against those
				tyrants who had expelled them from their homes and
				deprived them of visiting the House of Allah and made it
				difficult for them to follow the way of Islam. It was at
				this psychological occasion that these verses were sent
				down. That is why the purpose for which Masjid al Haram
				was built has been specifically mentioned. It has been
				made plain that Hajj (pilgrimage) had been enjoined for
				the worship of One Allah. But it is an irony that
				afterwards it had been dedicated to the rituals of shirk
				and the worshipers of One Allah had been debarred from
				visiting it. Therefore, permission for waging war against
				those tyrants has been given to oust them from there and
				to establish the righteous way of life for establishing
				virtue and eradicating evil. According to Ibn Abbas,
				Mujahid, Urwah bin Zubair, Zaid bin Aslam, Muqatil bin
				Hayyan, Qatadah and other great commentators, v. 39 is
				the first verse that grants the Muslims permission to
				wage war. Collections of Hadith and books on the life of
				the Holy Prophet confirm that after this permission
				actual preparations for war were started and the first
				expedition was sent to the coast of the Red Sea in Safar
				A.H. 2, which is known as the Expedition of Waddan or
				Al-Abwa.

				This Surah is addressed to: 
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					the mushriks of Makkah 
				</li>
				<li>
					the wavering Muslims 
				</li>
				<li>
					the True Believers. 
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				The mushriks have been warned in a forceful manner to
				this effect: "You have obdurately and impudently
				persisted in your ideas of ignorance and trusted in your
				deities instead of Allah, though they possess no power at
				all and you have repudiated the Divine Messenger. Now you
				will meet the same end as has been the doom of those like
				you before. You have only harmed yourselves by rejecting
				Our Prophet and by persecuting the best element of your
				own community; now your false deities shall not be able
				to save you from the wrath of God". At the same time,
				they have been admonished time and again for their creed
				of shirk and sound arguments have been given in favor of
				Tauhid and the Hereafter.
			</p>
			<p>
				The wavering Muslims, who had embraced Islam but were not
				prepared to endure any hardship in its way, have been
				admonished to this effect: "What is this faith of yours?
				On the one hand, you are ready to believe in Allah and
				become His servants provided you are given peace and
				prosperity but, on the other, if you meet with
				afflictions and hardships in His Way, you discard your
				Allah and cease to remain His servant. You should bear in
				mind that this wavering attitude of yours cannot avert
				those misfortunes and losses which Allah has ordained for
				you."
			</p>
			<p>
				As regards the true Believers, they have been addressed
				in two ways: 
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					In a general way so as to include the common
					people of Arabia also. 
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				The Believers have been told that the mushriks of Makkah
				had no right to debar them from visiting the Holy Mosque.
				They had no right to prevent anyone from performing Hajj
				because the Holy Mosque was not their private property.
				This objection was not only justified but it also acted
				as an effective political weapon against the Quraish. For
				it posed this question to the other clans of Arabia: Were
				the Quraish mere attendants of the Holy Mosque or its
				owners? It implied that if they succeeded in debarring
				the Muslims from Hajj without any protest from others,
				they would feel encouraged in future to debar from Hajj
				and Umrah the people of any other clan, who happened to
				have strained relations with the Quraish. In order to
				emphasize this point, the history of the construction of
				the Holy Mosque has been cited to show that it was built
				by Prophet Abraham by the Command of Allah and he had
				invited all the peoples to perform Hajj there. That is
				why those coming from outside had enjoyed equal rights by
				the local people from the very beginning. It has also
				been made clear that that House had not been built for
				the rituals of shirk but for the worship of One Allah.
				Thus it was sheer tyranny that the worship of Allah was
				being forbidden there while the worship of idols enjoyed
				full licence.
			</p>
			<p>
				In order to counteract the tyranny of the Quraish, the
				Muslims were allowed to fight with them. They were also
				given instructions to adopt the right and just attitude
				as and when they acquired power to rule in the land.
				Moreover, the Believers have been officially given the
				name of "Muslims", saying, "You are the real heirs to
				Abraham and you have been chosen to become witnesses of
				the Truth before mankind. Therefore you should establish
				salat and pay the zakat dues in order to become the best
				models of righteous life and perform Jihad for
				propagating the Word of Allah." (vv. 41,77, 78.) It will
				be worth while to keep in view the introductions to
				Chapters 2 (Al-Baqarah) and 8 (Al Anfal).

				indicate that it was revealed during the middle stage of
				Prophethood at Makkah. Reading between the lines, one
				feels that a bitter conflict had begun between the Holy
				Prophet and the disbelievers of Makkah, though the
				persecution by them had not yet become tyrannical. It
				appears that the surah was sent down during the climax of
				the "Famine" in Makkah (vv. 75-76), which according to
				authentic traditions occurred during the middle stage of
				Prophethood. Moreover, according to a tradition related
				by 'Urwah bin Zubair, Hadrat Umar who had embraced Islam
				by that time, said, "This Surah was revealed in my
				presence and I myself observed the state of the Holy
				Prophet during its revelation. When the revelation ended,
				the Holy Prophet remarked, 'On this occasion ten such
				verses have been sent down to me that the one who
				measures up to them, will most surely go to Paradise'.
				Then he recited the initial verses of the surah." (Ahmad,
				Tirmizi, Nasai, Hakim).

				This Surah takes its name, An Nur, from verse 35.

		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				The consensus of opinion is that it was sent down after
				the Campaign against Bani al-Mustaliq and this is
				confirmed by vv. 11-20 that deal with the incident of the
				"Slander", which occurred during that Campaign. But there
				is a difference of opinion as to whether this Campaign
				took place in 5 A.H. before the Battle of the Trench or
				in 6 A.H. after it. It is important to decide this issue
				in order to determine whether this Surah was sent down
				earlier or Surah Al-Ahzab (33), which is the only other
				Surah containing the Commandments about the observance of
				purdah by women. Surah Al-Ahzab was admittedly sent down
				on the occasion of the Battle of the Trench. Now if this
				Battle occurred earlier, it would mean that the initial
				instructions in connection with the Commandments of
				purdah were sent down in Surah Al-Ahzab and they were
				complemented later by the Commandments revealed in this
				Surah. On the other hand, if the Campaign against Bani
				al-Mustaliq occurred earlier, the chronological order of
				the Commandments would be reversed, and it would become
				difficult to understand the legal wisdom and implications
				of the Commandments of purdah.
			</p>
			<p>
				According to Ibn Sa'd, the Campaign against Bani al
				Mustaliq took place in Shaban 5 A.H. and the Battle of
				the Trench in Zil-Qa'dah the same year. This opinion is
				based on some traditions from Hadrat Ayesha about the
				events connected with the "Slander" in which she refers
				to a dispute between Hadrat Sa'd bin 'Ubadah and Sa'd bin
				Mu'az. Hadrat Sa'd bin Mu'az, according to authentic
				traditions, died during the Campaign against Bani
				Quraizah, which took place immediately after the Battle
				of the Trench. It is, therefore, evident that he could
				not be present in 6 A.H. to take part in a dispute about
				the "Slander".
			</p>
			<p>
				On the other hand, Muhammad bin Ishaq says that the
				Battle of the Trench took place in Shawwal 5 A.H. and the
				Campaign against Bani al-Mustaliq in Sha'aban 6 A.H. This
				opinion is supported by many authentic traditions from
				Hadrat Ayesha and others. According to these traditions, 
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					the Commandments about purdah had been sent down
					in Surah Al-Ahzab before the incident of the
					"Slander", 
				</li>
				<li>
					the Holy Prophet had married Hadrat Zainab in
					Zil-Qa'dah 5 A.H. after the Battle of the Trench, 
				</li>
				<li>
					Hamnah, sister of Hadrat Zainab, had taken a
					leading part in spreading the "Slander", just
					because Hadrat Ayesha was a rival of her sister.
					All this evidence supports the view of Muhammad
					bin Ishaq.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Now let us consider the two opinions a little more
				closely. The only argument in favor of the first opinion
				is the mention of the presence of Hadrat Sa'd bin Mu'az
				in a dispute connected with the incident of the
				"Slander". But this argument is weakened by some other
				traditions from Hadrat Ayesha, in which she mentions
				Hadara Usaid bin Hudair instead of Hadrat Sa'd bin Mu'az
				in this dispute. It may, therefore, be assumed that there
				has been some confusion regarding the two names in
				reporting the traditions. Moreover, if we accept the
				first opinion, just because of the mention of the name of
				Hadrat Sa'd bin Mu'az in some traditions, we encounter
				other difficulties that cannot be resolved in any way.
				For, in that case, we shall have to admit that the
				revelation of the Commandments of purdah and the Holy
				Prophet's marriage with Hadrat Zainab had taken place
				even earlier than the Battle of the Trench. But we learn
				from the Quran and many authentic traditions that both
				these events happened after that Battle and the Campaign
				against Bani Quraizah. That is why Ibn Hazm, Ibn Qayyim
				and some other eminent scholars have held the opinion of
				Muhammad bin Ishaq as correct, and we also hold it to be
				so. Thus, we conclude that Surah Al Ahzab was sent down
				earlier than Surah An-Nur, which was revealed in the
				latter half of 6 A.H. several months after Surah Al
				Ahzab.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Historical Background">
			<p>
				Now let us review the circumstances existing at the time
				of the revelation of this surah. It should be kept in
				mind that the incident of the "Slander", which was the
				occasion of its revelation, was closely connected with
				the conflict between Islam and the disbelievers.
			</p>
			<p>
				After the victory at Badr, the Islamic movement began to
				gain strength day by day; so much so that by the time of
				the Battle of the Trench, it had become so strong that
				the united forces of the enemy numbering about ten
				thousand failed to crush it and had to raise the siege of
				Al-Madinah after one month. It meant this, and both the
				parties understood it well, that the war of aggression
				which the Disbelievers had been waging for several years,
				had come to an end. The Holy Prophet himself declared:
				"After this year, the Quraish will not be able to attack
				you; now you will take the offensive."
			</p>
			<p>
				When the disbelievers realized that they could not defeat
				Islam on the battlefield, they chose the moral front to
				carry on the conflict. It cannot be said with certainty
				whether this Change of tactics was the outcome of
				deliberate consultations, or it was the inevitable result
				of the humiliating retreat in the Battle of the Trench,
				for which all the available forces of the enemy had been
				concentrated:They knew it well that the rise of Islam was
				nor due to the numerical strength of the Muslims nor to
				their superior arms and ammunition nor to their greater
				material resources; nay, the Muslims were fighting
				against fearful odds on all these fronts. They owed their
				success to their moral superiority. Their enemies
				realized that the pure and noble qualities of the Holy
				Prophet and his followers were capturing the hearts of
				the people, and were also binding them together into a
				highly disciplined community. As a result of this, they
				were defeating the mushriks and the Jews both on the
				peace and on the war front, because the latter lacked
				discipline and character.
			</p>
			<p>
				Under the above mentioned circumstances, the wicked
				designs of the disbelievers led them to start a campaign
				of vilification against the Holy Prophet and the Muslims
				in order to destroy the bulwark of morale that was
				helping them to defeat their enemies. Therefore the
				strategy was to attain the assistance of the hypocrites
				to spread slanders against the Holy Prophet and his
				followers so that the mushriks and the Jews could exploit
				these to sow the seeds of discord among the Muslims and
				undermine their discipline.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first opportunity for the use of the new strategy was
				afforded in Zil-Qa'dah 5 A.H. when the Holy Prophet
				married Hadrat Zainab (daughter of Jahsh), who was the
				divorced wife of his adopted son, Zaid bin Harithah. The
				Holy Prophet had arranged this marriage in order to put
				an end to the custom of ignorance, which gave the same
				status to the adopted son that was the right only of the
				son from one's own loins. The hypocrites, however,
				considered it a golden opportunity to vilify the Holy
				Prophet from inside the community, and the Jews and the
				mushriks exploited it from outside to ruin his high
				reputation by this malicious slander. For this purpose
				fantastic stories were concocted and spread to this
				effect: "One day Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him)
				happened to see the wife of his adopted son and fell in
				love with her; he maneuvered her divorce and married
				her." Though this was an absurd fiction it was spread
				with such skill, cunning and artfulness that it succeeded
				in its purpose; so much so that some Muslim
				traditionalist and commentators also have cited some
				parts of it in their writings, and the orientalists have
				exploited these fully to vilify the Holy Prophet. As a
				matter of fact, Hadrat Zainab was never a stranger to the
				Holy Prophet that he should see her by chance and fall in
				love with her at first sight. For she was his first
				cousin, being the daughter of his real paternal aunt,
				Umaimah, daughter of Abdul Muttalib. He had known her
				from her childhood to her youth. A year before this
				incident, he himself had persuaded her against her will
				to marry Hadrat Zaid in order to demonstrate practically
				that the Quraish and the liberated slaves were equal as
				human being. As she never reconciled herself to her
				marriage with a liberated slave, they could not pull on
				together for long, which inevitably led to her divorce.
				The above mentioned facts were well known to all, yet the
				slanderers succeeded in their false propaganda with the
				result that even today there are people who exploit these
				things to defame Islam.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second slander was made on the honor of Hadrat
				Ayesha, a wife of the Holy Prophet, in connection with an
				incident which occurred while he was returning from the
				Campaign against Bani al-Mustaliq. As this attack was
				even severer than the first one and was the main
				background of this Surah, we shall deal with it in
				greater detail.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let us say a few words about Abdullah bin Ubayy, who
				played the part of a villain in this attack. He belonged
				to the clan of Khazraj and was one of the most important
				chiefs of Al-Madinah. The people had even intended to
				make him their king a little before the Holy Prophet's
				migration there, but the scheme had to be dropped because
				of the changed circumstances. Though he had embraced
				Islam, he remained at heart a hypocrite and his hypocrisy
				was so manifest that he was called the "Chief of the
				Hypocrites". He never lost any opportunity to slander
				Islam in order to take his revenge.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now the main theme. When in Sha'aban 6 A.H. the Holy
				Prophet learned that the people of Bani al-Mustaliq were
				making preparations for a war against the Muslims and
				were trying to muster other clans also for this purpose,
				he fore- stalled and took the enemy by surprise. After
				capturing the people of the clan and their belongings,
				the Holy Prophet made a halt near Muraisi, a spring in
				their territory. One day a dispute concerning taking
				water from the spring started between a servant of Hadrat
				Umar and an ally of the clan of Khazraj, and developed
				into a quarrel between the Muhajirs (immigrants) and the
				Ansar (Muslims of Madina), but was soon settled. This,
				however, did not suit the strategy of Abdullah bin Ubayy,
				who also had joined the expedition with a large number of
				hypocrites. So he began to incite the Ansar, saying, "You
				yourselves brought these people of the quraish from
				Makkah and made them partners in your wealth and
				property. And now they have become your rivals and want
				domination over you. If even now you withdraw your
				support from them, they shall be forced to leave your
				city." Then he swore and declared, "As soon as we reach
				back Al-Madinah, the respectable people will turn out the
				degraded people from the city."
			</p>
			<p>
				When the Holy Prophet came to know of this, he ordered
				the people to set off immediately and march back to
				Al-Madinah. The forced march continued up to noon the
				next day without a halt on the way so that the people
				became exhausted and had no time for idle talk.
			</p>
			<p>
				Though this wise judgment and quick action by the Holy
				Prophet averted the undesirable consequences of the
				mischief, Abdullah bin Ubayy got another opportunity for
				doing a far more serious and greater mischief, i.e. by
				engineering a "Slander" against Hadrat Ayesha, for that
				was a mischief which might well have involved the young
				Muslim Community in a civil war, if the Holy Prophet and
				his sincere and devoted followers had not shown wisdom,
				forbearance and marvelous discipline in dealing with it.
				In order to understand the events that led to the
				incident of the "Slander", we cite the story in Hadrat
				'Ayesha's own words. She says "Whenever the Holy Prophet
				went out on a journey, he decided by lots as to which of
				his wives should accompany him. Accordingly, it was
				decided that I should accompany him during the expedition
				to Bani al Mustaliq. On the return journey, the Holy
				Prophet halted for the night at a place which was the
				last stage on the way back to Al-Madinah. It was still
				night, when they began to make preparations for the
				march. So I went outside the camp to ease myself. When I
				returned and came near my halting place, I noticed that
				my necklace had fallen down somewhere. I went back in
				search for it but in the meantime the caravan moved off
				and I was left behind all alone. The four carriers of the
				litter had placed it on my camel without noticing that it
				was empty. This happened because of my light weight due
				to lack of food in those days. I wrapped myself in my
				sheet and lay down in the hope that when it would be
				found that I had been left behind, a search party would
				come back to pick me up. In the meantime I fell asleep.
				In the morning, when Safwan bin Mu'attal Sulami passed
				that way, he saw me and recognized me for he had seen me
				several times before the Commandment about purdah had
				been sent down. No sooner did he see me than he stopped
				his camel and cried out spontaneously : "How sad! The
				wife of the Holy Prophet has been left here!" At this I
				woke up all of a sudden and covered my face with my
				sheet. Without uttering another word, he made his camel
				kneel by me and stood aside, while I climbed on to the
				camel back. He led the camel by the nose-string and we
				overtook the caravan at about noon, when it had just
				halted and nobody had yet noticed that I had been left
				behind. I learnt afterwards that this incident had been
				used to slander me and Abdullah bin Ubayy was foremost
				among the slanderers." (According to other traditions,
				when Hadrat Ayesha reached the camp on the camel, led by
				Safwan, and it was known that she had been left behind,
				Abdullahbin Ubayy cried out, 'By God, she could not have
				remained chaste. Look, there comes the wife of your
				Prophet openly on the camel led by the person with whom
				she passed the night.')
			</p>
			<p>
				"When I reached Al-Madinah, I fell ill and stayed in bed
				for more than a month. Though I was quite unaware of it,
				the news of the "Slander" was spreading like a scandal in
				the city, and had also reached the Holy Prophet. Anyhow,
				I noticed that he did not seem as concerned about my
				illness he used to be. He would come but without
				addressing me directly, would inquire from others how I
				was and leave the house. Therefore it troubled my mind
				that something had gone wrong somewhere. So I took leave
				of him and went to my mother's house for better nursing.
			</p>
			<p>
				"While I was there, one night I went out of the city to
				ease myself in the company of Mistah's mother, who was a
				first cousin of my mother. As she was walking along she
				stumbled over something and cried out spontaneously, 'May
				Mistah perish!' To this I retorted, 'What a good mother
				you are that you curse your own son, the son who took
				part in the Battle of Badr.' She replied, 'My dear
				daughter, are you not aware of his scandal mongering?'
				Then she told me everything about the campaign of the
				'Slander'." (Besides the hypocrites, some true Muslims
				also had been involved in this campaign, and among them
				who took leading part in it, were Mistah, Hassan bin
				Thabit, the famous poet of Islam, and Hamnah, daughter of
				Jahsh and sister of Hadrat Zainab). "Hearing this
				horrible story, my blood curdled, and I immediately
				returned home, and passed the rest of the night in crying
				over it.
			</p>
			<p>
				"During my absence the Holy Prophet took counsel with Ali
				and Usamah bin Zaid about this matter. Usamah said good
				words about me to this effect: 'O Messenger of Allah, we
				have found nothing but good in your wife. All that is
				being spread about her is a lie and calumny.' As regards
				Ali, he said, 'O Messenger of Allah, there is no dearth
				of women; you may, if you like, marry an other wife. If,
				however, you would like to investigate into the matter,
				you may send for her maid servant and inquire into it
				through her.' Accordingly, the maid servant was sent for
				and questioned. She replied, 'I declare on an oath by
				Allah, Who has sent you with the Truth, that I have never
				seen any evil thing in her, except that she falls asleep
				when I tell her to look after the kneaded dough in my
				absence and a goat comes and eats it.'
			</p>
			<p>
				"On that same day the Holy Prophet addressed the people
				from the pulpit, saying: 'O Muslims, who from among you
				will defend my honor against the attacker of the person
				who has transgressed all bounds in doing harm to me by
				slandering my wife. By God, I have made a thorough
				inquiry and found nothing wrong with her nor with the
				man, whose name has been linked with the "Slander".' At
				this Usaid bin Hudair (or Sa'd bin Mauz) according to
				other traditions) stood up and said, 'O Messenger of
				Allah, if that person belongs to our clan, we will kill
				him by ourselves, but if he belongs to the Khazraj clan,
				we will kill him if you order us to do so.' Hearing this
				Sa'd bin 'Ubadah, chief of the Khazraj clan, stood up and
				said, 'You lie you can never kill him. You are saying
				this just because the person belongs to our clan of
				Khazraj. Had he belonged to your clan, you would never
				have said so.' Hadrat Usaid retorted, 'You are a
				hypocrite: that is why you are defending a hypocrite.' At
				this, there was a general turmoil in the mosque, which
				would have developed into a riot, even though the Holy
				Prophet was present there the whole time. But he cooled
				down their anger and came down from the pulpit."
			</p>
			<p>
				The remaining details of the incident will be cited along
				with our commentary on the Text, which honorably absolved
				Hadrat Aishah from the blame. But here we would only want
				to point out the enormity of the mischief that was
				engineered by Abdullah bin Ubayy: 
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					It implied an attack on the honor of the Holy
					Prophet and Hadrat Abu Bakr Siddiq.
				</li>
				<li>
					He meant to undermine the high moral superiority
					which was the greatest asset of the Islamic
					Movement.
				</li>
				<li>
					He intended to ignite civil war between the
					Muhajirs and the Ansar, and between Aus and
					Khazraj, the two clans of the Ansar.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Topics ">
			<p>
				This Surah and vv. 28-73 of Surah Al-Ahzab (of which this
				is the sequel) were sent down to strengthen the moral
				front, which at that time was the main target of the
				attack, vv. 28-73 of Al-Ahzab were sent down concerning
				the Holy Prophet's marriage with Hadrat Zainab, and on
				the occasion of the second attack (the "Slander" about
				Hadrat Aishah), Surah An-Nur was sent down to repair the
				cracks that had appeared in the unity of the Muslim
				Community. If we keep this in view during the study of
				the two Surahs, we shall understand the wisdom that
				underlies the Commandments about purdah. Allah sent the
				following instructions to strengthen and safeguard the
				moral front, and to counteract the storm of propaganda
				that was raised on the occasion of the marriage of Hazrat
				Zainab:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					The wives of the Holy Prophet were enjoined to
					remain within their private quarters, to avoid
					display of adornments and to be cautious in their
					talk with other persons (vv. 32, 33).
				</li>
				<li>
					The other Muslims were forbidden to enter the
					private rooms of the Holy Prophet and instructed
					to ask whatever they wanted from behind the
					curtain.(v. 53).
				</li>
				<li>
					A line of demarcation was drawn between the
					mahram and the non-mahram relatives. Only the
					former were allowed to enter the private rooms of
					those wives of the Holy Prophet with whom they
					were so closely related as to prohibit marriage
					with them.(v. 55).
				</li>
				<li>
					The Muslims were told that the wives of the
					Prophet were prohibited for them just like their
					own real mothers; therefore every Muslim should
					regard them with the purest of intentions (vv.
					53, 54).
				</li>
				<li>
					The Muslims were warned that they would invite
					the curse and scourge of Allah if they offended
					the Holy Prophet. Likewise it was a heinous sin
					to attack the honor of or slander any Muslim man
					or woman.(vv. 57, -8).
				</li>
				<li>
					All the Muslim women were enjoined to cover their
					faces with their sheets if and when they had to
					go out of their houses.(v. 59).
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				On the occasion of the second attack, this Surah was sent
				down to keep pure and strengthen the moral fiber of the
				Muslim society, which had been shaken by the enormity of
				the slander. We give below a summary of the Commandments
				and instructions in their chronological order so that one
				may understand how the Quran makes use of the
				psychological occasion to reform the Community by the
				adoption of legal, moral and social measures.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Fornication which had already been declared to be
					a social crime (4:15,16) was now made a criminal
					offence and was to be punished with a hundred
					lashes.
				</li>
				<li>
					It was enjoined to boycott the adulterous men and
					women and the Muslims were forbidden to have any
					marriage relations with them.
				</li>
				<li>
					The one, who accused the other of adultery but
					failed to produce four witnesses, was to be
					punished with eighty lashes.
				</li>
				<li>
					The Law of Lian was prescribed to decide the
					charge of adultery against his own wife by a
					husband.
				</li>
				<li>
					The Muslims were enjoined to learn a lesson from
					the incident of the "Slander" about Hadrat
					Aishah, as if to say, "You should be very
					cautious in regard to charges of adultery against
					the people of good reputation, and should not
					spread these; nay, you should refute and suppress
					them immediately." In this connection, a general
					principle was enunciated that the proper spouse
					for a pure man is a pure woman, for he cannot
					pull on with a wicked woman for long, and the
					same is the case with a pure woman, as if to say,
					"When you knew that the Holy Prophet was a pure
					man, nay, the purest of all human beings, how
					could you believe that he had experienced
					happiness with a wicked woman and exalted her as
					the most beloved of his wives? For it was obvious
					that an adulterous woman could not have been able
					to deceive, with her affected behavior, a pure
					man like the Holy Prophet. You ought also to have
					considered the fact that the accuser was a mean
					person while the accused was a pure woman. This
					should have been enough to convince you that the
					accusation was not worth your consideration; nay,
					it was not even conceivable.
				</li>
				<li>
					Those who spread news and evil rumors and
					propagate wickedness in the Muslim Community,
					deserve punishment and not encouragement.
				</li>
				<li>
					A general principle was laid down that relations
					in the Muslim Community should be based on good
					faith and not on suspicion: everyone should be
					treated as innocent unless he is proved to be
					guilty and vice versa.
				</li>
				<li>
					The people were forbidden to enter the houses of
					others unceremoniously and were instructed to
					take permission for this.
				</li>
				<li>
					Both men and women were instructed to lower their
					gaze and forbidden to cast glances or make eyes
					at each other.
				</li>
				<li>
					Women were enjoined to cover their heads and
					breasts even inside their houses.
				</li>
				<li>
					Women were forbidden to appear with make-up
					before other men except their servants or such
					relatives with whom their marriage is prohibited.
				</li>
				<li>
					They were enjoined to hide their make-ups when
					they went out of their houses, and even forbidden
					to put on jingling ornaments, while they moved
					out of their houses.
				</li>
				<li>
					Marriage was encouraged and enjoined even for
					slaves and slave girls, for unmarried people help
					spread indecency.
				</li>
				<li>
					The institution of slavery was discouraged and
					the owners and other people were enjoined to give
					financial help to the slaves to earn their
					freedom under the law of Mukatabat.
				</li>
				<li>
					Prostitution by slave girls was forbidden in the
					first instance, for prostitution in Arabia was
					confined to this class alone. This in fact
					implied the legal prohibition of prostitution.
				</li>
				<li>
					Sanctity of privacy in home life was enjoined
					even for servants and under age children
					including one's own. They were enjoined not to
					enter the private rooms of any man or woman
					without permission; especially in the morning, at
					noon and at night.
				</li>
				<li>
					Old women were given the concession that they
					could set aside their head covers within their
					houses but should refrain from display of
					adornments. Even they were told that it was
					better for them to keep themselves covered with
					head wrappers.
				</li>
				<li>
					The blind, lame, crippled and sick persons were
					allowed to take any article of food from the
					houses of other people without permission, for it
					was not to be treated like theft and cheating,
					which are cognizable offenses.
				</li>
				<li>
					On the other hand, the Muslims were encouraged to
					develop mutual relationships by taking their
					meals together, and the nearest relatives and
					intimate friends were allowed to take their meals
					in each other's house without any formal
					invitation. This was to produce mutual affection
					and sincere relationships between them to
					counteract any future mischief. Side by side with
					these instructions, clear signs of the Believers
					and the hypocrites were stated to enable every
					Muslim to discriminate between the two. At the
					same time the Community was bound together by
					adopting disciplinary measures in order to make
					it stronger and firmer than it was at the time so
					as to discourage the enemies from creating
					mischief in it.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Above all, the most conspicuous thing about this
				discourse is that it is free from the bitterness which
				inevitably follows such shameful and absurd attacks.
				Instead of showing any wrath at this provocation, the
				discourse prescribes some laws and regulations and
				enjoins reformative commandments and issues wise
				instructions that were required at the time for the
				education and training of the Community. Incidentally,
				this teaches us how to deal with such provocative
				mischiefs coolly, wisely and generously. At the same
				time, it is a clear proof that this is not the word of
				Prophet Muhammad (Allah's peace and blessings be upon
				him) but of a Being Who is observing all human conditions
				and affairs from the highest level, and guiding mankind
				without any personal prejudices, feelings and leanings.
				Had this been the word of the Hoiy Prophet; there would
				have been at least some tinge of natural bitterness in
				spite of his great generosity and forbearance, for it is
				but human that a noble man naturally become enraged when
				his own honor is attacked in this mean manner.

				The Surah takes its name "Al-Furqan" from the first
				verse. Though it is symbolic like the names of many other
				Surahs, it has a close relation to its subject matter.

		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				It appears from its style and subject matter that, like
				Surah Al-Mumineen, it was also revealed during the third
				stage of Prophethood at Makkah. Ibn Jarir and Imam Razi
				have cited a tradition of Dahhak bin Muzahim that this
				Surah was revealed eight years before Surah An Nisa. This
				also confirms our opinion as to its period of revelation.
				(Ibn Jarir, Vol. XIX, pp. 28-30, and Tafsir Kabir, Vol.

				The Surah deals with the doubts and objections that were
				being raised against the Quran, the Prophethood of
				Muhammad (Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and
				his teachings by the disbelievers of Makkah. Appropriate
				answers to each and every objection have been given and
				the people have been warned of the consequences of
				rejecting the Truth. At the end of the Surah, a clear
				picture of the moral superiority of the Believers has
				been depicted as in the beginning of Surah Al-Mu'minun,
				as if to say, 'Here is the criterion for distinguishing
				the genuine from the counterfeit. This is the noble
				character of those people who have believed in and
				followed the teachings of the Holy Prophet and this is
				the kind of people that he is trying to train. You may
				yourselves compare and contrast this type of people with
				those Arabs, who have not as yet accepted the Message,
				and who are upholding "ignorance" and exerting their
				utmost to defeat the Truth. Now you may judge for
				yourselves as to which you would like to choose." Though
				this question was not posed in so many words, it was
				placed before every one in Arabia in a tangible shape. It
				may be noted that during the next few years, the
				practical answer given to this question by the whole
				nation, with the exception of a small minority, was that
				they chose Islam.

				The Surah takes its name from verse 224 in which the word
				Ash-Shuaraa' occurs.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				The subject matter and the style show, and the traditions
				confirm, that it was revealed during the middle Makkan
				period. According to Ibn Abbas, Surah Ta Ha was revealed
				first, then Surah Al Waqiah, and then Surah
				Ash-Shu'araa.(Ruh-ul-Ma'ani, Vol. xIx, p. 64). About
				Surah Ta Ha it is well known that it had been revealed
				before Hadrat Umar embraced Islam.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Subject Matter and Topics">
			<p>
				The background of the Surah is that the disbelievers of
				Makkah were persistently refusing, on one pretext or the
				other, to accept the message of Islam given by the Holy
				Prophet. Sometimes they would say that he did not show
				them any sign to convince them of his Prophethood;
				sometimes they would brand him as a poet or a sorcerer
				and mock his message; and sometimes they would ridicule
				his Mission, saying that his followers were either a few
				foolish youth, or the poor people and slaves whereas,
				they argued, if his Mission had really some value for the
				people, the nobles and the elders would have accepted it
				first. Thus, while on the one hand, the Holy Prophet was
				becoming wearied by his efforts to show them rationally
				the errors of their creeds and prove the truth of the
				Doctrines of Tauhid and the Hereafter, the disbelievers,
				on the other, were never tired of adopting one kind of
				obduracy after the other. This state of affairs was
				causing great anguish and grief to the Holy Prophet.
			</p>
			<p>
				Such were the conditions when this Surah was revealed. It
				begins with words of consolation to the Holy Prophet,
				implying, "Why do you fret for their sake? If these
				people have not believed in you, it is not because they
				have not seen any Sign, but because they are obdurate.
				They will not listen to reason, they want to see a Sign
				which makes them bow their heads in humility. When this
				Sign is shown in due course of time, they will themselves
				realize that what was being presented to them was the
				Truth."
			</p>
			<p>
				After this introduction, till verse 191, one and the same
				theme has been presented continuously, and it is said:
				"The whole earth abounds in such Signs as can guide a
				seeker after truth to Reality, but the stubborn and
				misguided people have never believed even after seeing
				the Signs, whether these were the Signs of the natural
				phenomena or the miracles of the Prophets. These wretched
				people have stubbornly adhered to their erroneous creeds
				till the Divine scourge actually overtook them." It is to
				illustrate this that the history of seven of the ancient
				tribes has been told, who persisted in disbelief just
				like the disbelievers of Makkah. In this connection, the
				following points have been stressed:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					The Signs are of two kinds:
				</li>
				<li>
					The mentality of the disbeliever has been the
					same throughout the ages; their arguments and
					their objections, and their excuses and
					subterfuges for not believing have been similar
					and ultimately the fates that they met have also
					been the same. Likewise, the Prophets in every
					age presented the same teachings, their personal
					character and their reasoning and arguments
					against their opponents were the same, and they
					were all similarly blessed with mercy by Allah
					Almighty. Both these patterns of behavior and
					conduct are found in history, and the
					disbelievers could themselves see as to which
					respective patterns they and the Holy Prophet
					belonged.
				</li>
				<li>
					Allah is All Mighty, All Powerful and All
					Merciful at the same time. History contains
					instances of His Wrath as well as of His Mercy.
					Now, therefore, it is for the people to decide
					whether they would like to deserve Allah's Mercy
					or His Wrath.
				</li>
				<li>
					Lastly, the discussion has been summed up, saying
					"O disbelievers, if at all you want to see the
					Signs, why should you insist on seeing those
					horrible Signs that visited the doomed
					communities of the past? Why don't you see the
					Quran which is being presented in your own
					language? Why don't you see Muhammad (upon whom
					be Allah's peace and mercy) and his Companions?
					Can the revelations of the Quran be the work of a
					satan or a jinn? Does the recipient of the Quran
					appear to be a sorcerer? Are Muhammad and his
					Companions no different from a poet and his
					admirers? Why don't you give up disbelief and
					search your hearts for their judgment? When in
					the heart of your hearts you yourselves believe
					that the Revelations of the Quran have nothing in
					common with sorcery and poetry, then you should
					know that you are being cruel and unjust, and
					will certainly meet the doom meant for the cruel
					and unjust."
				</li>
			</ol>
			<ol type="A">
				<li>
					those which are scattered all over the earth, and
					by seeing which an intelligent person can judge
					for himself whether what the Prophet is
					presenting is the Truth or not
				</li>
				<li>
					those which were seen by Pharaoh and his people,
					Noah's people, the Ad and the Thamud, Lot's
					people and the people of Aiykah. Now it is for
					the disbelievers to decide which kind of the
					Signs they are eager to see.
				</li>

			<p>
				The Surah takes its name from the phrase wadin-naml which
				occurs in verse 18, implying that it is a Surah in which
				the story of An-Naml (the Ant) has been related.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				The subject matter and the style bear full resemblance
				with the Surahs of the middle Makkan period and this is
				supported by traditions as well. According to Ibn Abbas
				and Jabir bin Zaid, "First the Surah Ash Shuaraa was sent
				down, then the Surah An Naml and then Al-Qasas."
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Topics">
			<p>
				The Surah consists of two discourses, the first from the
				beginning of the Surah to the end of verse 58, and the
				second from verse 59 to the end of the Surah. The theme
				of the first discourse is that only those people can
				benefit from the guidance of the Quran and become worthy
				of the good promises made in it, who accept the realities
				which this Book presents as the basic realities of the
				universe, and then follow up their belief with obedience
				and submission in their practical lives as well. But the
				greatest hindrance for man to follow this way is the
				denial of the Hereafter. For it makes him irresponsible,
				selfish and given to worldly life, which in turn makes it
				impossible for him to submit himself before God and to
				accept the moral restrictions on his lusts and desires.
				After this introduction three types of character have
				been presented.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first type is characterized by Pharaoh and the chiefs
				of Thamud and the rebels of the people of Lot, who were
				all heedless of the accountability of the Hereafter and
				had consequently become the slaves of the world. These
				people did not believe even after seeing the miracles.
				Rather they turned against those who invited them to
				goodness and piety. They persisted in their evil ways
				which are held in abhorrence by every sensible person.
				They did not heed the admonition even until a moment
				before they were overtaken by the scourge of Allah.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second type of character is of the Prophet Solomon
				(peace be upon him), who had been blessed by God with
				wealth and kingdom and grandeur to an extent undreamt of
				by the chiefs of the disbelievers of Makkah. But, since
				he regarded himself as answerable before God and had the
				feeling that whatever he had was only due to Allah's
				bounty, he had adopted the attitude of obedience before
				Him and there was no tinge of vanity in his character.
			</p>
			<p>
				The third type is of the queen of Sheba, who ruled over a
				most wealthy and well known people in the history of
				Arabia. She possessed all those means of life, which
				could cause a person to become vain and conceited. Her
				wealth and possessions far exceeded the wealth and
				possessions of the Quraish. Then she professed shirk,
				which was not only an ancestral way of life with her, but
				she had to follow it in order to maintain her position as
				a ruler. Therefore, it was much more difficult for her to
				give up shirk and adopt the way of tauhid than it could
				be for a common mushrik. But when the Truth became
				evident to her, nothing could stop her from accepting it.
				Her deviation was, in fact, due to her being born and
				brought up in a polytheistic environment and not because
				of her being a slave to her lusts and desires. Her
				conscience was not devoid of the sense of accountability
				before God.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the second discourse, at the outset, attention has
				been drawn to some of the most glaring and visible
				realities of the universe, and the disbelievers of Makkah
				have been asked one question after the other to the
				effect: "Do these realities testify to the creed of shirk
				which you are following, or to the truth of tauhid to
				which the Quran invites you?" After this the real malady
				of the disbelievers has been pointed out, saying, "The
				thing which has blinded them and made them insensitive to
				every glaring reality is their denial of the Hereafter.
				This same thing has rendered every matter and affair of
				life non-serious for them. For, when according to them,
				everything has to become dust ultimately, and the whole
				struggle of life is purposeless and without an object
				before it, the truth and falsehood are equal and alike.
				Therefore, the question whether one's system of life is
				based on the right or wrong foundations, becomes
				meaningless for him."
			</p>
			<p>
				But the discourse, as outlined above, is not meant to
				dissuade the Prophet and the Muslims from calling the
				obdurate and heedless people to the way of tauhid; it is,
				in fact, intended to arouse them from their slumber. That
				is why in vv. 67-93 certain things have been said
				repeatedly in order to produce in the people a sense of
				the Hereafter, to warn them of the consequences of being
				heedless of it, and to convince them of its coining, like
				an eye witness of something, who convinces the other
				person of it, who has not seen it.
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, the real invitation of the Quran, that is,
				the invitation to serve One Allah alone, has been
				presented in a concise but forceful manner, and the
				people warned that accepting it would be to their own
				advantage and rejecting it to their own disadvantage. For
				if they deferred their faith until they saw those Signs
				of God after the appearance of which they would be left
				with no choice but to believe and submit, they should
				bear in mind the fact that that would be the time of
				judgment and believing then would be of no avail.
			</p>
		</section>
	</sura>
	<sura num="28">
		<section heading="Name">
			<p>
				The Surah takes its name from verse 25 in which the word
				Al-Qasas occurs. Lexically, qasas means to relate events
				in their proper sequence. Thus, from the viewpoint of the
				meaning too, this word can be a suitable title for this
				Surah, for in it the detailed story of the Prophet Moses
				has been related.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				As already mentioned in the introduction to Surah An
				Naml, according to Ibn Abbas and Jabir bin Zaid, Surahs
				Ash-Shuaraa, An-Naml and Al-Qasas were sent down one
				after the other. The language, the style and the theme
				also show that the period of the revelation of these
				three Surahs is nearly the same. Another reason for their
				close resemblance is that the different parts of the
				Prophet Moses story as mentioned in these surahs together
				make up a complete story. In Surah Ash-Shuaraa, excusing
				himself for not accepting the office of Prophethood the
				Prophet Moses submits, "The people of Pharaoh have the
				charge of a crime against me; therefore, I fear that they
				will put me to death." Then, when he goes before Pharaoh,
				the latter says, "Did we not bring you up as a child in
				our house? You lived quite a few years of your life among
				us, and then you did what you did." Nothing more of this
				has been mentioned there, but in this Surah the other
				details have been supplied. Similarly, in Surah An-Naml
				the story starts abruptly from the time when the Prophet
				Moses was journeying with his family and suddenly saw a
				fire at a distance. In that Surah nothing has been said
				about the nature of his journey, or the place he was
				coming from, or his destination, but this Surah supplies
				all the necessary details. Thus, the three Surahs read
				together complete the story of the Prophet Moses (Allah's
				peace be upon him).
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Topics">
			<p>
				The main theme is to remove the doubts and objections
				that were being raised against the Prophethood of the
				Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and
				blessings) and to invalidate the excuses which were being
				offered for not believing in him.
			</p>
			<p>
				For this purpose, first the story of the Prophet Moses
				has been related, which, by analogy with the period of
				revelation, impresses the following points in the
				listener's mind automatically:
			</p>
			<p>
				First, Allah provides the means and motives of whatever
				He wills to do, in imperceptible ways. Thus, Allah so
				arranged things that the child through whom Pharaoh had
				to be removed from power, was bred and brought up in his
				own house, and he could not know whom he was fostering.
				Who can then fight God and frustrate Him by his
				machinations.
			</p>
			<p>
				Secondly, Prophethood is not granted to a person amid
				festivities by issuing a proclamation from the earth and
				heavens. You wonder how Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's
				peace) has been blessed with Prophethood unexpectedly,
				all of a sudden, but Moses whom you yourselves
				acknowledge as a Prophet (v. 48) had also become a
				Prophet unexpectedly, while on a journey, and nobody had
				known what event had occurred in the desolation at the
				foot of Mt. Sinai. Even Moses himself did not know a
				moment before what he was going to be blessed with. He,
				in fact, had gone to bring a piece of the fire but had
				returned with the gift of Prophethood
			</p>
			<p>
				Thirdly, the person from whom Allah wants to take some
				service comes out without any army and armor and without
				an apparent helper or force at his back, yet he puts to
				rout much stronger and better equipped opponents. The
				contrast that existed between the strengths of Moses
				(peace be upon him) and Pharaoh was much more prominent
				and glaring than that which existed between Muhammad
				(peace be upon him) and the quraish; yet the world knows
				who had come out victorious in the end and who had been
				routed.
			</p>
			<p>
				Fourthly, you refer to Moses again and again and say,
				"Why has Muhammad not been given the same which was given
				to Moses? i.e. miracles of the staff, the shining land,
				etc. as if to suggest that you would readily believe only
				if you were shown the kind of the miracles that were
				shown by Moses to Pharaoh. But do you know what sort of
				response was made by those who were shown those miracles?
				They had not believed even after seeing the miracles, and
				had only said, "This is magic", for they were involved in
				stubbornness and hostility to the Truth. The same malady
				afflicts you today. Will you believe only when you are
				shown the same kind of miracles? Then, do you know what
				fate the disbelievers had met even after seeing the
				miracles? They were annihilated by Allah. Do you now wish
				to meet the same doom by asking for the miracles in your
				obstinacy?
			</p>
			<p>
				These were the things which were automatically impressed
				in the mind of every listener who heard this story in the
				pagan environment of Makkah, for a similar conflict was
				going on at that time between the Holy Prophet and
				disbelievers of Makkah as had already taken place between
				the Prophet Moses and Pharaoh before. This was the
				background against which the story of the Prophet Moses
				was narrated so that a perfect analogy was established
				automatically in every detail between the conditions
				prevailing then in Makkah and those existing in the time
				of the Prophet Moses. Then, from verse 43 onward the
				discourse turns to the real theme.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the first place, the narration of a two thousand year
				old historical event by the Holy Prophet with such
				accuracy and detail, is presented as a proof of his
				Prophethood although he was illiterate and the people of
				his city and clan knew full well that he had no access to
				any source of such information as they could point out.
				Then his appointment as a Prophet is put forward as
				Allah's mercy to them, for they were heedless and Allah
				had made this arrangement for their guidance. Then their
				oft-repeated objection, "Why has not this Prophet brought
				the miracles which Moses had brought?" has been answered.
				It is said to them, "How can you be justified in
				demanding miracles from this Prophet when you did not
				believe in Moses either, who, as you yourselves
				acknowledge, had brought miracles from God? You can still
				see the truth only if you do not serve your lusts and
				whims. But if you remained afflicted with this malady,
				you would never see it even though you were shown any
				kind of miracles."
			</p>
			<p>
				Then the disbelievers of Makkah have been warned and put
				to shame for an event that occurred in those very days.
				Some Christians had come to Makkah and embraced Islam
				when they heard the Quran from the Holy Prophet. Instead
				of learning any lesson from this the Makkans were so
				upset at this that their leader, Abu Jahl, disgraced
				those people publicly. In conclusion, the excuse that the
				disbelievers put forward for not believing in the Holy
				Prophet has been dealt with. What they feared was this:
				"If we give up the polytheistic creed of the Arabs and
				accept the doctrine of Tauhid instead, this will put an
				end to our supremacy in the religious, political and
				economic fields, which, in turn, will destroy our
				position of the most influential tribe of Arabia and we
				shall be left with no refuge anywhere in the land." As
				this was the real motive of the chiefs of the Quraish for
				their antagonism towards the Truth, and their doubts and
				objections were only the pretenses, which they invented
				to deceive the common people, Allah has dealt with these
				fully till the end of the Surah, considered each aspect
				of these in a wise manner and offered the remedy for
				their basic ailment due to which those people judged the
				Truth and falsehood only from the viewpoint of their
				worldly interests.

				The Surah takes its name from verse 41 in which the word
				Ankabut (Spider) has occurred.

		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				Verses 56 to 60 clearly show that this Surah was sent
				down a little before the migration to Habash, and this is
				supported by the internal evidence of the subject matter
				as well. Some commentators have opined that since it
				mentions the hypocrites, and hypocrisy appeared in
				Madinah, the first ten verses of this Surah were revealed
				at Madinah and the rest of it at Makkah; whereas the
				people whose hypocrisy has been mentioned here are those
				who had adopted a hypocritical way of life because they
				were afraid of the oppression and extreme physical
				torture to which the Muslims were being subjected by the
				disbelievers. Evidently, this kind of hypocrisy could be
				there only at Makkah and not at Madinah. Similarly, some
				other commentators, seeing that in this Surah the Muslims
				have been exhorted to migrate, have regarded it as the
				last Surah to be revealed at Makkah, whereas the Muslims
				had migrated to Habash even before their migration to
				Madinah. These opinions are not based on any tradition
				but on the internal evidence of the subject matter, and
				this internal evidence, when considered against the
				subject matter of the Surah as a whole, points to the
				conditions prevailing in the time of the migration to
				Habash and not to the last stage at Makkah.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject matter">
			<p>
				A perusal of the Surah shows that the period of its
				revelation was the period of extreme persecution of the
				Muslims at Makkah. The disbelievers were opposing and
				fighting Islam tooth and nail and the new converts were
				being subjected to the severest oppression. Such were the
				conditions when Allah sent down this Surah to strengthen
				and encourage the sincere Muslims as well as to put to
				shame those who were showing weakness of the faith.
				Besides, the disbelievers of Makkah have been threatened
				and warned not to invite for themselves the fate that the
				antagonists of the Truth have been experiencing in every
				age.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this connection, the questions that some young men
				were facing in those days, have also been answered. For
				instance, their parents were urging them to abandon
				Muhammad (may Allah's peace be upon him), and return to
				their ancestral religion, for they argued: "The Quran in
				which you have put your faith, regards the rights of the
				parents as the uppermost; therefore, listen to what we
				say; otherwise you will be working against the dictates
				of your own Faith." This has been answered in verse 8.
			</p>
			<p>
				Similarly, the people of some clans said to the new
				converts to Islam, "Leave the question of punishments,
				etc., to us. Listen to us and abandon this man. If God
				seizes you in the Hereafter, we will come forward and
				say, 'Lord, these people are innocent: we had forced them
				to give up the Faith; therefore, seize us'." This has
				been dealt with, in vv. 12-13.
			</p>
			<p>
				The stories mentioned in this Surah also impress the same
				point mostly, as if to say, "Look at the Prophets of the
				past: they were made to suffer great hardships and were
				treated cruelly for long periods. Then, at last they were
				helped by Allah. Therefore, take heart: Allah's succor
				will certainly come. But a period of trial and
				tribulation has to be undergone." Besides teaching this
				lesson to the Muslims, the disbelievers also have been
				warned, as if to say, "If you are not being immediately
				seized by Allah, you should not form the wrong impression
				that you will never be seized. The signs of the doomed
				nations of the past are before you. Just see how they met
				their doom and how Allah succored the Prophets."
			</p>
			<p>
				Then the Muslims have been instructed to the effect: "If
				you feel that the persecution has become unbearable for
				you, you should give up your homes, instead of giving up
				your Faith: Allah's earth is vast: seek a new place where
				you can worship Allah with the full peace of mind."
			</p>
			<p>
				Besides all this, the disbelievers also have been urged
				to understand Islam. The realities of Tauhid and the
				Hereafter have been impressed with rational arguments,
				shirk have been refuted, and drawing their attention
				towards the signs in the universe, they have been told
				that all these Signs confirm the teachings that the
				Prophet is presenting before them.

				The Surah takes its name Ar-Rum from the second verse in

		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				The period of the revelation of this Surah is determined
				absolutely by the historical event that has been
				mentioned at the outset. It says: "The Romans have been
				vanquished in the neighbouring land." In those days the
				Byzantine occupied territories adjacent to Arabia were
				Jordan, Syria and Palestine, and in these territories the
				Romans were completely overpowered by the Iranians in 615
				A.D. Therefore, it can be said with absolute certainty
				that this Surah was sent down in the same year, and this
				was the year in which the migration to Habash took place.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Historical Background">
			<p>
				The prediction made in the initial verses of this Surah
				is one of the most outstanding evidences of the Quran's
				being the Word of Allah and the Holy Prophet Muhammad's
				being a true Messenger of Allah. Let us have a look at
				the historical background relevant to the verses.
			</p>
			<p>
				Eight years before the Holy Prophet's advent as a Prophet
				the Byzantine Emperor Maurice was overthrown by Phocus,
				who captured the throne and became king. Phocus first got
				the Emperor's five sons executed in front of him, and
				then got the Emperor also killed and hung their heads in
				a thoroughfare in Constantinople. A few days after this
				he had the empress and her three daughters also put to
				death. The event provided Khusrau Parvez, the Sassanid
				king of Iran; a good moral excuse to attack Byzantium.
				For Emperor Maurice had been his benefactor; with his
				help he had got the throne of Iran. Therefore, he
				declared that he would avenge his godfather's and his
				children's murder upon Phocus, the usurper. So, he
				started war against Byzantium in 603 A. D. and within a
				few years, putting the Phocus armies to rout in
				succession, he reached Edessa (modern, Urfa) in Asia
				Minor, on the one hand, and Aleppo and Antioch in Syria,
				on the other. When the Byzantine ministers saw that
				Phocus could not save the country, they sought the
				African governor's help, who sent his son, Heraclius, to
				Constantinople with a strong fleet. Phocus was
				immediately deposed and Heraclius made emperor. He
				treated Phocus as he had treated Maurice. This happened
				in 610 A.D., the year the Holy Prophet was appointed to
				Prophethood.
			</p>
			<p>
				The moral excuse for which Khusrau Parvez had started the
				war was no more valid after the deposition and death of
				Phocus. Had the object of his war really been to avenge
				the murder of his ally on Phocus for his cruelty, he
				would have come to terms with the new Emperor after the
				death of Phocus. But he continued the war, and gave it
				the color of a crusade between Zoroastrianism and
				Christianity. The sympathies of the Christian sects (i.e.
				Nestorians and Jacobians, etc.) which had been
				excommunicated by the Roman ecclesiastical authority and
				tyrannized for years also went with the Magian
				(Zoroastrian) invaders, and the Jews also joined hands
				with them; so much so that the number of the Jews who
				enlisted in Khusrau's army rose up to 26,000.
			</p>
			<p>
				Heraclius could not stop this storm. The very first news
				that he received from the East after ascending the throne
				was that of the Iranian occupation of Antioch. After this
				Damascus fell in 613 A.D. Then in 614 A.D. the Iranians
				occupying Jerusalem played havoc with the Christian
				world. Ninety thousand Christians were massacred and the
				Holy Sepulcher was desecrated. The Original Cross on
				which, according to the Christian belief, Jesus had died
				was seized and carried to Mada'in. The chief priest
				Zacharia was taken prisoner and all the important
				churches of the city were destroyed. How puffed up was
				Khusrau Parvez at this victory can be judged from the
				letter that he wrote to Heraclius from Jerusalem. He
				wrote: "From Khusrau, the greatest of all gods, the
				master of the whole world : To Heraclius, his most
				wretched and most stupid servant: 'You say that you have
				trust in your Lord. why didn't then your Lord save
				Jerusalem from me?'"
			</p>
			<p>
				Within a year after this victory the Iranian armies
				over-ran Jordan, Palestine and the whole of the Sinai
				Peninsula, and reached the frontiers of Egypt. In those
				very days another conflict of a far greater historical
				consequence was going on in Makkah. The believers in One
				God, under the leadership of the Prophet Muhammad (may
				Allah's peace be upon him), were fighting for their
				existence against the followers of shirk under the
				command of the chiefs of the Quraish, and the conflict
				had reached such a stage that in 615 A.D., a substantial
				number of the Muslims had to leave their homes and take
				refuge with the Christian kingdom of Habash, which was an
				ally of the Byzantine Empire. In those days the Sassanid
				victories against Byzantium were the talk of the town,
				and the pagans of Makkah were delighted and were taunting
				the Muslims to the effect: "Look the fire worshipers of
				Iran are winning victories and the Christian believers in
				Revelation and Prophethood are being routed everywhere.
				Likewise, we, the idol worshipers of Arabia, will
				exterminate you and your religion."
			</p>
			<p>
				These were the conditions when this Surah of the Quran
				was sent down, and in it a prediction was made,
				saying:"The Romans have been vanquished in the
				neighbouring land and within a few years after their
				defeat, they shall be victorious. And it will be the day
				when the believers will rejoice in the victory granted by
				Allah." It contained not one but two predictions: First,
				the Romans shall be Victorious; and second, the Muslims
				also shall win a victory at the same time. Apparently,
				there was not a remote chance of the fulfillment of the
				either prediction in the next few years. On the one hand,
				there were a handful of the Muslims, who were being
				beaten and tortured in Makkah, and even till eight years
				after this prediction there appeared no chance of their
				victory and domination. On the other, the Romans were
				losing more and more ground every next day. By 619 A.D.
				the whole of Egypt had passed into Sassanid hands and the
				Magian armies had reached as far as Tripoli. In Asia
				Minor they beat and pushed back the Romans to Bosporus,
				and in 617 A.D. they captured Chalcedon (modern, Kadikoy)
				just opposite Constantinople. The Emperor sent an envoy
				to Khusrau, praying that he was ready to have peace on
				any terms, but he replied, "I shall not give protection
				to the emperor until he is brought in chains before me
				and gives up obedience to his crucified god and adopts
				submission to the fire god." At last, the Emperor became
				so depressed by defeat that he decided to leave
				Constantinople and shift to Carthage (modern, Tunis). In
				short, as the British historian Gibbon says, even seven
				to eight years after this prediction of the Quran, the
				conditions were such that no one could even imagine that
				the Byzantine Empire would ever gain an upper hand over
				Iran. Not to speak of gaining domination, no one could
				hope that the Empire, under the circumstances, would even
				survive.
			</p>
			<p>
				When these verses of the Quran were sent down, the
				disbelievers of Makkah made great fun of them, and Ubayy
				bin Khalaf bet Hadrat Abu Bakr ten camels if the Romans
				became victorious within three years. When the Holy
				Prophet came to know of the bet, he said, "The Quran has
				used the words bid i sinin, and the word bid in Arabic
				applies to a number up to ten. Therefore, make the bet
				for ten years and increase the number of camels to a
				hundred." So, Hadrat Abu Bakr spoke to Ubayy again and
				bet a hundred camels for ten years.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 622 A.D. as the Holy Prophet migrated to Madinah, the
				Emperor Heraclius set off quietly for Trabzon from
				Constantinople via the Black Sea and started preparations
				to attack Iran from rear. For this he asked the Church
				for money, and Pope Sergius lent him the Church
				collections on interest, in a bid to save Christianity
				from Zoroastrianism. Heraclius started his counter attack
				in 623 A.D. from Armenia. Next year, in 624 A.D., he
				entered Azerbaijan and destroyed Clorumia, the birthplace
				of Zoroaster, and ravaged the principal fire temple of
				Iran. Great are the powers of Allah, this was the very
				year when the Muslims achieved a decisive victory at Badr
				for the first time against the mushriks. Thus both the
				predictions made in Surah Rum were fulfilled
				simultaneously within the stipulated period of ten years.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Byzantine forces continued to press the Iranians hard
				and in the decisive battle at Nineveh (627 A.D.) they
				dealt them the hardest blow. They captured the royal
				residence of Dastagerd, and then pressing forward reached
				right opposite to Ctesiphon, capital of Iran in those
				days. In 628 A. D. in an internal revolt, Khusrau Parvez
				was imprisoned and 18 of his sons were executed in front
				of him and a few days later he himself died in the
				prison. This was the year when the peace treaty of
				Hudaibiya was concluded, which the Quran has termed as
				"the supreme victory", and in this very year Khusrau's
				son, Qubad II, gave up all the occupied Roman
				territories, restored the True Cross and made peace with
				Byzantium. In 628 A.D., the Emperor himself went to
				Jerusalem to instal the "Holy Cross" in its place, and in
				the same year the Holy Prophet entered Makkah for the
				first time after the Hijrah to perform the
				Umrah-tul-Qada.
			</p>
			<p>
				After this no one could have any doubt about the truth of
				the prophecy of the Quran, with the result that most of
				the Arab polytheists accepted Islam. The heirs of Ubayy
				bin Khalaf lost their bet and had to give a hundred
				camels to Hadrat Abu Bakr Siddiq. He took them before the
				Holy Prophet, who ordered that they be given away in
				charity, because the bet had been made at a time when
				gambling had not yet been forbidden by the Shariah; now
				it was forbidden. Therefore, the bet was allowed to be
				accepted from the belligerent disbelievers, but
				instruction given that it should be given away in charity
				and should not be brought in personal use.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject matter">
			<p>
				The discourse begins with the theme that the Romans have
				been overcome and the people the world over think that
				the empire is about to collapse, but the fact is that
				within a few years the tables will be turned and the
				vanquished will again become victorious.
			</p>
			<p>
				This introductory theme contains the great truth that man
				is accustomed to seeing only what is apparent and
				superficial. That which is behind the apparent and
				superficial he does not know. When in the petty matters
				of life, this habit to see only the apparent and
				superficial can lead man to misunderstandings and
				miscalculations, and when he is liable to make wrong
				estimates only due to lack of knowledge about "what will
				happen tomorrow", how stupendous will be his error if he
				risks his whole life-activity by placing reliance only
				upon what is visible and apparent with respect to his
				worldly life as a whole. Then, from the question of the
				conflict between Byzantium and Iran the direction of the
				discourse turns to the theme of the Hereafter, and as far
				as verse 27, man has been made to understand in different
				ways that the Hereafter is possible as well as rational
				and necessary; then for the sake of keeping the system of
				his life also stable and balanced it is absolutely
				necessary that he should plan and order his present life
				on the faith in the Hereafter; otherwise he will commit
				the same error as has always been the result of placing
				one's reliance only upon the apparent and the visible.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this connection, the Signs of the universe which have
				been presented as evidence to prove the doctrine of the
				Hereafter are precisely the same which support the
				doctrine of Tauhid. Therefore from verse 28 onward, the
				discourse turns to the affirmation of Tauhid and the
				refutation of shirk, and it is stressed that the natural
				way of life for man is none else but to serve One God
				exclusively. Shirk is opposed to the nature of the
				universe as to the nature of man. Therefore, whenever man
				has adopted this deviation, chaos has resulted. Again
				here, an allusion has been made to the great chaos that
				had gripped the world on account of the war between the
				two major powers of the time, and it has been indicated
				that this chaos too, is the result of shirk, and all the
				nations who were ever involved in mischief and chaos in
				the history of mankind were also mushriks.
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, a parable has been presented to make the
				people understand that just as dead earth comes to life,
				all of a sudden, by a shower of rain sent by God and
				swells with vegetation and plant life, so is the case
				with the dead humanity. When God sends a shower of His
				mercy in the form of Revelation and Prophethood, it also
				gives a new life to mankind and causes it to grow and
				develop and flourish. Therefore: "If you take full
				advantage of this opportunity, the barren land of Arabia
				will bloom by Allah's mercy and the whole advantage will
				be your. But if you do not take advantage of it, you will
				harm only your selves. Then no regret will avail and no
				opportunity will be provided to make amends."

				The Surah has been named Luqman after Luqman the Sage,

				12-19 of this Surah.

		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				A perusal of the subject matter shows that it was sent
				down in the period when persecution to suppress and
				thwart the invitation to Islam had begun and every sort
				of machination had started being employed for the
				purpose. This is borne out by vv. 14,15, in which the
				young converts to Islam have been told that although the
				rights of the parents are the uppermost after God, they
				should not listen to them if they prevented them from
				accepting Islam, or compelled them to revert to the creed
				of shirk and polytheism. The same thing has been said in
				Surah Al-Ankabut, which indicates that both these Surahs
				were sent down in the same period. A study of the style
				and subject matter of the two Surahs on the whole,
				however, shows that Surah Luqman was sent down earlier,
				for one does not see any sign of the antagonism in its
				background though, contrary to this, while studying Surah
				Al-Ankabut one can clearly feel that the Muslims were
				being severely persecuted during the period of its
				revelation.

		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject matter">
			<p>
				In this Surah the people have been made to under- stand
				the meaninglessness and absurdity of shirk and the truth
				and reasonableness of Tauhid, and they have been invited
				to give up blind imitation of their forefathers, consider
				with a cool mind the teachings which the Prophet Muhammad
				(upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings) is presenting
				from the Lord of the worlds, and see with open eyes the
				manifest Signs found in the universe around them and in
				their own selves, which bear evidence to its truth.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this connection, it has also been pointed out that
				this is not a new teaching which might have been
				presented in the world, or in the land of Arabia, for the
				first time, and with which the people might be
				unfamiliar. The learned and wise people of the past ages
				said and taught the same thing which Muhammad (upon whom
				be Allah's peace) is teaching today. It is as if to say,
				"O people: In your own country there has lived a wise
				man, named Luqman, whose wisdom has been well known among
				you, whose proverbs and wise sayings are cited in your
				daily conversation and who is often quoted by your poets
				and orators. Now you should see for yourselves what creed
				and what morals he used to teach."

				The Surah has been entitled As-Sajda after the theme of
				Sadja (prostration) as expressed in verse 15.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				From the style of the Surah it appears that it was sent
				down during the middle Makkah period, more particularly
				in its initial stage, for one does not find in its
				background that severity of the persecution and tyranny
				which one finds in the Surahs sent down in the later
				stages.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Topics">
			<p>
				The main theme of the Surah is to remove the doubts of
				the people concerning Tauhid, the Hereafter and the
				Prophethood, and to invite them to all these three
				realities. The disbelievers of Makkah, when they talked
				of the Holy Prophet in private, said to one another,
				"This person is forging strange things, sometimes he
				gives news of what will happen after death. He says: when
				you have become dust, you will be called to render your
				accounts, and there will be Hell and Heaven. Sometimes he
				says: these gods and goddesses and saints are
				nonentities: One God alone is the Deity. And sometimes he
				says: the discourses which I recite are not my own but
				Allah's Word. All these are strange things which he
				presents." The answer to these doubts and misgivings
				forms the theme and subject matter of this Surah.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this connection, the disbelievers have been told:
				"Most certainly it is Allah's Word, which has been sent
				down in order to arouse a people who are sunk in
				heedlessness, being deprived of the bounties and
				blessings of Prophethood. How can you call it a
				fabrication when its having been sent dawn from Allah is
				manifest and self-evident?"
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, they have been asked, "Use your common sense and
				judge for yourselves which of the things presented by the
				Quran is strange and novel? Look at the administration of
				the heavens and the earth: consider your own creation and
				structure. Don't these things testify to the teaching
				which this Prophet is presenting before you in the Quran?
				Does the system of the universe point to Tauhid or to
				shirk? When you consider this whole system and your own
				creation, does your intellect testify that the One Who
				has given you your present existence, will not be able to
				create you once again?"
			</p>
			<p>
				Then a scene of the Hereafter has been depicted, the
				fruits of belief and the evil consequences of disbelief
				have been mentioned and the people exhorted to give up
				disbelief even before they meet their doom and accept the
				teaching of the Quran, which will be to their own
				advantage in the Hereafter. Then they have been told: It
				is Allah's supreme Mercy that He does not seize man
				immediately for his errors to punish him finally and
				decisively but warns him beforehand by afflicting him
				with small troubles and hardships and calamities and
				losses and strokes of misfortune so that he may wake up
				and take admonition.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then it is said: "This is not the first and novel event
				of its kind that a Book has been sent down upon a man
				from God. Before this the Book had been sent upon Moses
				also, which you all know. There is nothing strange in
				this at which you should marvel. Be assured that this
				Book has come down from God, and note it well that the
				same will happen now as has already happened in the time
				of Moses. Leadership now will be bestowed only on those
				who will accept this Divine Book. Those who reject it
				shall be doomed to failure."
			</p>
			<p>
				Then the disbelievers of Makkah have been admonished to
				the effect: "See the end of the doomed communities of the
				past by whose ruined habitations you pass during your
				trade journeys. Will you like to meet the same doom
				yourself? Do not be deluded by the apparent and
				superficial. Today you see that no one is listening to
				Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) except a few young
				men and some slaves and poor men, and he is being made
				the target of curses and ugly remarks from every side.
				From this you have formed the wrong impression that his
				mission will fail. But this is only a deception of your
				eyes. Don't you see the phenomenon in your daily life
				that a land previously lying absolutely barren starts
				swelling with vegetation and plant life everywhere just
				by a single shower of the rain though before this no one
				could ever imagine that under the layers of its soil
				there lay hidden such treasures of greenery and herbage?"
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, the Holy Prophet has been addressed to the
				effect: "These people mock at what you say and ask as to
				when you will attain this decisive victory. Tell them:
				when the time comes for the final judgment regarding you
				and us, believing then will not profit you at all. If you
				have to believe, believe now. But if you intend to await
				the final judgment, then await it as you please."

				The Surah derives its name Al-Ahzab from verse 20.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				The Surah discusses three important events which are: the
				Battle of the Trench (or Al-Ahzab: the Clans), which took
				place in Shawwal, A.H. 5; the raid on Bani Quraizah,
				which was made in Dhil-Qa'dah, A.H. 5; and the Holy

			<p>
				The Islamic army's setback in the Battle of Uhud (A.H. 3)
				that resulted from the error of the archers appointed by
				the Holy Prophet so boosted up the morale of the Arab
				pagans and the Jews and the hypocrites that they started
				entertaining the hope that they would soon be able to
				exterminate Islam and the Muslims completely. Their high
				state of morale can be judged from the events that
				occurred in the first year after Uhud. Hardly two months
				had passed then the tribe of Bani Asad of Najd began to
				make preparations for a raid on Madinah, and the Holy
				Prophet had to despatch an expedition under Abu Salamah
				to counteract them. In Safar A.H. 4 some people of the
				tribes of Adal and Qarah asked the Holy Prophet to send
				some men to instruct them in Islam. Accordingly six of
				the Companions were allowed to accompany them for the
				purpose. But when they reached Raji (a place between
				Rabigh and Jeddah), they summoned Hudhail against them,
				who killed four of the Companions, and took the other two
				(Hadrat Khubaib bin Adi and Hadrat Zaid bin ad-Dathinnah)
				to Makkah and sold them to the enemy. Then in the same
				month of Safar, on the request of a chief of Bani Amir,
				the Holy Prophet sent another deputation of 40 (according
				to others, 70) preachers, consisting of the Ansar young
				men, to Najd. But they were also betrayed. The people of
				Usayyah and Ri'l and Dhakwan, tribes of Bani Sulaim,
				surrounded them suddenly at Bir Maunah and slew all of
				them. Meanwhile the Jewish tribe of Bani an-Nadir of
				Madinah, getting encouragement, continued to commit
				breaches of the treaties; so much so that in Rabi'ul
				Awwal, A.H. 4, they plotted against the life of the Holy
				Prophet himself. Then in Jamadi al-Ula, A.H. 4, Bani
				Thalbah and Bani Muharib, the two tribes of Bani
				Ghatafan, started making preparations to attack Madinah
				and the Holy Prophet had to go to punish them. Thus,
				after their setback at Uhud, the Muslims went on
				encountering repercussions continuously for seven to
				eight months.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, it was the Holy Prophet's determination and
				wisdom and his great Companions' spirit of sacrifice that
				changed these adverse conditions completely within a
				short span of time. The economic boycott by the Arabs had
				made life hard for the people of Madinah. All the
				polytheistic tribes around Madinah were becoming
				rebellious. Inside Madinah itself the Jews and the
				hypocrites were beat upon mischief. But the successive
				steps taken by a handful of the sincere Muslims, under
				the leadership of the Holy Prophet, not only restored the
				image of strength of Islam in Arabia but also increased
				it manifold.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Raids Preceding the Battle of the Trench">
			<p>
				The first such step was taken immediately after the
				Battle of Uhud. The very next day when quite a large
				number of Muslims lay wounded and the martyrdom of the
				near and dear ones was being mourned in many houses, and
				the Holy Prophet himself was injured and sad at the
				martyrdom of his uncle, Hadrat Hamzah, he called out to
				the devoted servants of Islam to accompany him in pursuit
				of the pagans so as to deter them from returning and
				attacking Madinah again. The Holy Prophet's assessment
				was absolutely correct. He knew that, although the
				Quraish had retreated without taking any advantage of
				their almost complete victory, they would certainly
				regret their folly when they would halt and consider the
				whole matter coolly on the way, and would return to
				attack Madinah again. Therefore, he decided to go in
				pursuit of them, and 630 of of the Muslims at once
				volunteered to accompany him. When they reached Hamra
				al-Asad on the way to Makkah and camped there for three
				days, the Holy Prophet came to know through a sympathetic
				non-Muslim that Abu Sufyan had stayed at Ar-Rauha, 36
				miles short of Madinah, with an army 2,978 strong: they
				were regretting their error and were, in fact, planning
				to return and attack Madinah once again. But when they
				heard that the Holy Prophet was coming in pursuit of them
				with an army, they lost heart and gave up their plan.
				Thus, not only were the Quraish deterred by this action
				but the other enemies living around Madinah also realized
				that the Muslims were being led by a person who was
				highly well informed, wise and resolute, and that the
				Muslims were ever ready to lay down their lives at his
				command. (For further details, see Introduction to Surah
				Al Imran.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then as soon as the Bani Asad started making preparations
				for a raid on Madinah, the Holy Prophet's secret agents
				gave him timely information about their intention. Thus,
				before they could come in force to attack Madina, he sent
				an army 150 strong, under Hadrat Abu Salamah (the first
				husband of Hadrat Umm Salamah) to punish them. They took
				Bani Asad by surprise, who fled in panic leaving all
				their possessions behind, which fell into the Muslim
				hands.
			</p>
			<p>
				After this came the turn of the Bani an-Nadir. The day
				they plotted against the life of the Holy Prophet, and
				the secret was disclosed, the Holy Prophet ordered them
				to leave Madinah within ten days and warned that anyone
				who remained behind after that would be put to death.
				Abdullah bin Ubayy, the chief of the hypocrites of
				Madinah, encouraged them to defy the order and refuse to
				leave Madinah. He even promised to help them with 2,000
				men, and assured them that the Bani Ghatafan from Najd
				also would come to their aid. Accordingly, the Bani
				an-Nadir sent word that they would not leave no matter
				what the Holy Prophet might do.
			</p>
			<p>
				As soon as the time limit of ten days come to an end, the
				Holy Prophet laid siege to their quarters, but none of
				their supporters had the courage to come to their rescue.
				At last, they surrendered on condition that every three
				of them would be allowed to load a camel with whatever
				they could carry and go away leaving the rest of their
				possessions behind. Thus, the whole suburbs of the city
				which were inhabited by the Bani an-Nadir, and their
				gardens and their fortresses and other properties fell to
				the Muslims, and the people of this treacherous tribe
				became scattered in Khaiber, Wad il Qura and Syria.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then the Holy Prophet turned his attention to the Bani
				Ghatafan, who were preparing for a war against Madinah.
				He took 400 of the Muslims and overtook them at Dhat
				ar-Riqa. They were so taken by surprise that they fled
				their houses without a struggle and took refuge in the
				mountains.
			</p>
			<p>
				After this in Shaban A.H. 4, the Holy Prophet went forth
				to Badr to fight Abu Sufyan. At the end of the Battle of
				Uhud, he had challenged the Holy Prophet and the Muslims,
				saying, "We shall again meet you in combat at Badr next
				year." In reply the Holy Prophet announced through a
				Companion: "All right: we accept your challenge."
				Accordingly, at the appointed time he reached Badr with
				1,500 of the Muslims. From the other side, Abu Sufyan
				left Makkah with an army of 2,000 men, but could not have
				the courage to march beyond Marr-az-Zahran (modern, Wadi
				Fatimah). The Holy Prophet waited for him at Badr for
				eight days; the Muslims during these days did profitable
				business with a trading party. This incident helped more
				than restore the image of strength of the Muslims that
				had been tarnished at Uhud. It also made the whole of
				Arabia realize that the Quraish alone could no longer
				resist Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and
				blessings).
			</p>
			<p>
				This image and position of the Muslims was further
				strengthened by another event. Dumat al-Jandal (modern,
				Al-Jauf) was an important place at the border between
				Arabia and Syria. When the caravans of the Arabs, trading
				between Iraq in the south and Syria and Egypt in the
				north, passed that way, they were harassed and looted by
				the natives. In Rabi al-Awwal, A.H. 5, the Holy Prophet
				himself went to punish them with an army of 1,000 men.
				They could not muster up courage to come out and fight
				him and, therefore, fled the place. This caused the whole
				of northern Arabia to dread the power of Islam, and the
				tribes began to realize that the great power emerging
				from Al-Madinah was formidable and could no longer be
				resisted by one or a few of the tribes.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="The Battle of the Trench">
			<p>
				Such were the conditions when the Battle of the Trench
				took place. It was in fact a combined raid by many of the
				Arab tribes, who wanted to crush the power of Madinah. It
				had been instigated by the leaders of the Bani an-Nadir,
				who had settled in Khaiber after their banishment from
				Madinah. They went round to the Quraish and Ghatafan and
				Hudhail and many other tribes and induced them to gather
				all their forces together and attack Madinah jointly.
				Thus, in Shawwal, A.H. 5, an unprecedented large army of
				the Arab tribes marched against the small city of
				Madinah. From the north came Jews of Bani an-Nadir and
				Bani Qainuqa who after their banishment from Madinah, had
				settled in Khaiber and Wad il Qura. From the east
				advanced the tribes of Ghatafan, Bani Sulaim, Fazarah,
				Murrah, Ashja, Sad, Asad, etc. and from the south the
				Quraish, along with a large force of their allies.
				Together they numbered from ten to twelve thousand men.
			</p>
			<p>
				Had it been a sudden attack, it would have been
				disastrous. But the Holy Prophet was not unaware of this
				in Madinah. His intelligence men and the sympathizers of
				the Islamic movement and the people influenced by it were
				present in every tribe, who kept him informed of the
				enemy's movements. Even before the enemy could reach his
				city, he got a trench dug out on the north-west of
				Madinah in six days, and having the Mount Salat their
				back, took up a defensive position with 3,000 men in the
				protection of the Trench. To the south of Madinah there
				were many gardens (even now there are) so that it could
				not be attacked from that side. To the east there are
				lava rocks which are impassable for a large army. The
				same is the case with the south western side. The attack,
				therefore, could be made only from the eastern and
				western sides of the Uhud, which the Holy Prophet had
				secured by digging a trench. The disbelievers were not at
				all aware that they would have to counter the trench
				outside Madinah. This kind of a defensive stratagem was
				unknown to the Arabs. Thus, they had to lay a long siege
				in winter for which they had not come prepared.
			</p>
			<p>
				After this, only one alternative remained with the
				disbelievers: to incite the Jewish tribe of Bani
				Quraizah, who inhabited the southeastern part of the
				city, to rebellion. As the Muslims had entered a treaty
				with them that in case of an attack on Madinah they would
				defend the city along with them, the Muslims had made no
				defensive arrangement there and had even sent their
				families to take shelter in the forts situated on that
				side. The invaders perceived this weakness of the Islamic
				defenses. They sent Huyayy bin Akhtab, the Jewish leader
				of the Bani an-Nadir, to the Bani Quraizah so as to
				induce them to break the treaty and join the war. In the
				beginning, they refused to oblige and said that they had
				a treaty with Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) who
				had faithfully abided by it and given them no cause for
				complaint. But when Ibn Akhtab said to them, "Look, I
				have summoned the united force of entire Arabia against
				him: this is a perfect opportunity to get rid of him. If
				you lose it, you will never have another opportunity,"
				the anti Islamic Jewish mind prevailed over every moral
				consideration and the Bani Quraizah were persuaded to
				break the treaty.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Holy Prophet received news of this. He at once told
				Sad bin Ubadah, Sad bin Muadh, Abdullah bin Rawahah and
				Khawwat bin Jubair, chiefs of the Ansar, to go and find
				out the truth. He advised them that if they found Bani
				Quraizah still loyal to the treaty, they should return
				and say so openly before the Muslim army; however, if
				they found that they were bent upon treachery they should
				only inform him so that the common Muslims would not be
				disheartened. On reaching there the Companions found the
				Bani Quraizah fully bent on mischief. They told the
				Companions openly, "There is no agreement and no treaty
				between us and Muhammad." At this they returned to the
				Islamic army and submitted their report to the Holy
				Prophet, saying, "'Adal and Qarah." That is, "The
				Quraizah are bent upon doing what the Adal and Qarah had
				done with the preachers of Islam at Raji."
			</p>
			<p>
				This news spread among the Muslims and caused great
				consternation among them, for they had been encircled and
				their city had been endangered on the side where there
				existed no defensive arrangement and where they had also
				sent their families to take shelter in the forts. This
				further increased the activities of the hypocrites and
				they started making psychological attacks to break the
				morale of the Muslims. One said, "How strange!We were
				being foretold that the lands of Caesar and Chosroes
				would fall to us, but here we are that not one of us can
				go out even to relieve himself." Another one asked for
				permission to leave his post at the Trench so that he
				could go and protect his own house which was in danger.
				Another one started making secret propaganda to the
				effect: "Settle your affair with the invaders yourselves
				and hand over Muhammad to them." This was a highly
				critical hour of trial, which exposed every person who
				harbored any hypocrisy in his heart. Only the true and
				sincere Muslims remained firm and steadfast in their
				resolve and devotion.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Holy Prophet at that critical moment initiated peace
				negotiations with the Ban Ghatafan and tried to persuade
				them to accept one third of the fruit harvest of Madinah
				and withdraw. But when he asked Sad bin Ubadah and Sad
				bin Muadh, chief of the Ansar, for their opinion about
				the conditions of peace, they said, "O Messenger of
				Allah: Is it your personal wish that we should agree on
				these conditions, or is it Allah's Command that we have
				no option but to accept it?Or, are you giving this
				proposal only in order to save us from the enemy?" The
				Holy Prophet replied, "I am proposing this only to save
				you: I see that the whole of Arabia has formed a united
				front against you. I want to divide the enemy." At this
				the two chiefs protested; saying, "Sir, if you want to
				conclude this pact for our sake, kindly forget it. These
				tribes could not subdue us under tribute when we were
				polytheists. Now that we have the honor of believing in
				Allah and His Messenger, will they make us sink to this
				depth of ignominy? The sword now shall be the arbiter
				till Allah passes His judgment between them and us." With
				these words they tore up the draft for the treaty which
				had not yet been signed.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the meantime Nuaim bin Masud, a member of the Ashja
				branch of the Ghatafan tribe, became a Muslim and came
				before the Holy Prophet and submitted: "No one as yet
				knows that I have embraced Islam: You can take from me
				whatever service you please." The Holy Prophet replied:
				"Go and sow the seeds of discord among the enemy."' So,
				first of all, Nuaim went to the Quraizah with whom he was
				on friendly terms, and said to them, "The Quraish and the
				Ghatafan can become wearied of the siege and go back, and
				they will lose nothing, but you have to live here with
				the Muslims. Just consider what will be your position if
				the matter turns that way. Therefore, I would advise you
				not to join the enemy until the outsiders should send
				some of their prominent men as hostages to you." This had
				the desired effect upon the Bani Quraizah and they
				decided to demand hostages from the united front of the
				tribes. Then he went to the chiefs of the Quraish and the
				Ghatafan and said to them, "The Bani Quraizah seem to be
				slack and irresolute. May be they demand some men as
				hostage from you, and then hand them over to Muhammad
				(upon whom be Allah's peace) to settle their affair with
				him. Therefore, be very firm and cautious in your dealing
				with them." This made the leaders of the united front
				suspicious of Bani Quraizah, and they sent them a
				message, saying, "We are tired of the long siege; let
				there be a decisive battle; let us, therefore, make a
				general assault simultaneously from both the sides." The
				Bani Quraizah sent back the word, saying, "We cannot
				afford to join the war unless you hand over some of your
				prominent men to us as hostages." The leaders of the
				united front became convinced that what Nuaim had said
				was true. They refused to send hostages. And the Bani
				Quraizah, on the other side, also felt that Nuaim had
				given them the correct counsel. Thus, the strategy
				worked: it divided the enemy against itself.
			</p>
			<p>
				The siege was prolonged for more than 25 days. It was
				winter. The supply of food and water and forage was
				becoming more and more scarce everyday and division in
				the camp was also a great strain on the state of morale
				of the besiegers. Then, suddenly one night a severe
				windstorm accompanied by thunder and lightning hit the
				camp. It added to the cold and darkness. The wind
				overthrew the tents and put the enemy in disarray. They
				could not stand this severe blow of nature. They left the
				battleground even during the night and returned to their
				homes. When the Muslims awoke in the morning, there was
				not a single enemy soldier to be seen on the battlefield.
				The Holy Prophet, finding the battlefield completely
				empty, said: "The Quraish will never be able to attack
				you after this: now you will take the offensive." This
				was a correct assessment of the situation. Not only the
				Quraish but the united front of all the enemy tribes had
				made their final assault against Islam and had failed.
				Now they could no longer dare invade Madinah; now the
				Muslims were on the offensive.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Raid on Bani Quraizah">
			<p>
				When the Holy Prophet returned from the Trench, Gabriel
				came to him in the early afternoon with the Divine
				Command the the Muslims should not lay aside the arms yet
				but should deal with the Bani Quraizah as well. On
				receipt of this Command, the Holy Prophet announced:
				"Everyone who is steadfast in obedience should not offer
				his Asr Prayer till he reaches the locality of the Bani
				Quraizah." Immediately after this, he despatched Hadrat
				Ali with a contingent of soldiers as vanguard towards the
				Quraizah. When they reached there, the Jews climbed on to
				their roof tops and started hurling abuses on the Holy
				Prophet and the Muslims, but their invectives could not
				save them from the consequences of their treachery. They
				had committed breach of the treaty right at the most
				critical moment of the war, joined hands with the
				invaders and endangered the entire population of Madinah.
				When they saw the contingent of Hadrat Ali, they thought
				that they had come only to overawe them. But when the
				whole Islamic army arrived under the command of the Holy
				Prophet himself and laid siege to their quarters, they
				were very frightened. They could not stand the severity
				of the siege for more than two or three weeks. At last,
				they surrendered themselves to the Holy Prophet on the
				condition that they would accept whatever decision Hadrat
				Sad bin Muadh, the chief of the Aus, would give. They had
				accepted Hadrat Sad as their judge because in the
				pre-Islamic days the Aus and the Quraizah had been
				confederates and they hoped that in view of the past ties
				he would help them quit Madinah as had happened in the
				case of the Bani Qainuqa and the Bani an-Nadir before.
				The people of the Aus themselves wished that Hadrat Sad
				treat their previous allies leniently. But Hadrat Sad had
				just experienced and seen how the two Jewish tribes who
				had been allowed to leave Madinah previously had
				instigated the other tribes living around Madinah and
				summoned the united front of ten to twelve thousand men
				against the Muslims. He was also aware how treacherously
				this last Jewish tribe had behaved right on the occasion
				when the city was under attack from outside and
				threatened the safety of the whole of its population.
				Therefore, he decreed that all the male members of the
				Quraizah should be put to death, their women and children
				taken prisoners, and their properties distributed among
				the Muslims. The sentence was carried out duly. When the
				Muslims entered their strongholds they found that the
				treacherous people had collected 1,500 swords, 300 coats
				of mail, 2,000 spears and 1,500 shields in order to join
				the war. If Allah's succor had not reached the Muslims,
				all this military equipment would have been used to
				attack Madinah from the rear right at the time when the
				polytheists were making preparations for a general
				assault on the Muslims after crossing the Trench. After
				this disclosure there remained no doubt that the decision
				of Hadrat Sad concerning those people was absolutely
				correct.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Social Reforms">
			<p>
				Though the period of two years between the Battles of
				Uhud and the Trench was a period of disturbance and
				turmoil and the Holy Prophet and his Companions could
				hardly relax in peace and security even for a day, the
				work of reform as a whole and the reconstruction of the
				Muslim society continued uninterrupted. This was the time
				when the Islamic laws pertaining to marriage and divorce
				were complemented; the law of inheritance was introduced,
				drinking and gambling were prohibited, and the new laws
				and regulations concerning many other aspects of the
				economic and social life were enforced.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this connection, an important thing that needed to be
				reformed was the question of the adoption of a son.
				Whoever was adopted by the Arabs as a son was regarded as
				one of their own offspring: he got share in inheritance;
				he was treated like a real son and real brother by the
				adopted mother and the adopted sister; he could not marry
				the daughter of his adopted father and his widow after
				his death. And the same was the case if the adopted son
				died or divorced a wife. The adopted father regarded the
				woman as his real daughter-in-law. This custom clashed in
				every detail with the laws of marriage and divorce and
				inheritance enjoined by Allah in Surahs Al-Baqarah and
				An-Nisa. It made a person who could get no share in
				inheritance entitled to it at the expense of those who
				were really entitled to it. It prohibited marriage
				between the men and the women who could contract marriage
				perfectly lawfully. And, above all, it helped spread the
				immoralities which the Islamic Law wanted to eradicate.
				For a real mother and a real sister and a real daughter
				cannot be like the adopted mother and the adopted sister
				and the adopted daughter, however one may try to sanctify
				the adopted relations as a custom. When the artificial
				relations endued with customary sanctity are allowed to
				mix freely like the real relations, it cannot but produce
				evil results. That is why the Islamic law of marriage and
				divorce, the law of inheritance and the law of the
				prohibition of adultery required that the concept and
				custom of regarding the adopted son as the real son
				should be eradicated completely.
			</p>
			<p>
				This concept, however, could not be rooted out by merely
				passing a legal order, saying, The adopted son is not the
				real son. The centuries old prejudices and superstitions
				cannot be changed by mere word of mouth. Even if the
				people had accepted the command that these relations were
				not the real relations, they would still have looked upon
				marriage between the adopted mother and the adopted son,
				the adopted brother and the sister, the adopted father
				and the daughter, and the adopted father- in-law and the
				daughter-in-law odious and detestable. Moreover, there
				would still exist some freedom of mixing together freely.
				Therefore, it was inevitable that the custom should be
				eradicated practically, and through the Holy Prophet
				himself. For no Muslim could ever conceive that a thing
				done by the Holy Prophet himself, and done by him under
				Allah's Command, could be detestable. Therefore, a little
				before the Battle of the Trench, the Holy Prophet was
				inspired by Allah that he should marry the divorced wife
				of his adopted son, Zaid bin Harithah (may Allah be
				pleased with him), and he acted on this Command during
				the siege of the Bani Quraizah. (The delay probably was
				caused for the reason that the prescribed waiting period
				had not yet ended, and in the meantime the Holy Prophet
				had to become busy in the preparation for war).
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Storm of Propaganda at the Marriage of Hadrat Zainab">
			<p>
				As soon as the marriage was contracted, there arose a
				storm of propaganda against the Holy Prophet. The
				polytheists, the hypocrites and the Jews, all were
				burning with jealousy at his triumphs which followed one
				after the other. The way they had been humbled within two
				years after Uhud, in the Battle of the Trench, and in the
				affair of the Quraizah, had made them sore at heart. They
				had also lost hope that they could ever subdue him on the
				battlefield. Therefore, they seized the question of this
				marriage as a godsend for themselves and thought they
				would put an end to his moral superiority, which was the
				real secret of his power and success. Therefore, stories
				were concocted that Muhammad, God forbid, had fallen in
				love with his daughter-in-law, and when the son had come
				to know of this, he divorced his wife, and the father
				married his daughter-in-law. The propaganda, however, was
				absurd on the face of it. Hadrat Zainab was the Holy
				Prophet's first cousin. He had known her from childhood
				to youth. So, there could be no question of his falling
				in love with her at first sight. Then he himself had
				arranged her marriage with Hadrat Zaid under his personal
				influence, although her whole family had opposed it. They
				did not like that a daughter of the noble Quraish should
				be given in marriage to a freed slave. Hadrat Zainab
				herself was not happy at this arrangement. But everyone
				had to submit to the Holy Prophet's command. The marriage
				was solemnized and a precedent was set in Arabia that
				Islam had raised a freed slave to the status of the
				Quraish nobility. If the Holy Prophet had in reality any
				desire for Hadrat Zainab, there was no need of marrying
				her to Hadrat Zaid; he himself could have married her.
				But in spite of all this, the shameless opponents
				invented stories of love, spread them with great
				exaggeration and publicized them so vehemently that even
				some Muslims also began to accept them as true.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Preliminary Commandments of Purdah">
			<p>
				The fact that the tales invented by the enemies also
				became topics of conversation among the Muslims was a
				clear sign that the element of sensuality in society had
				crossed all limits. If this malady had not been there, it
				was not possible that minds would have paid any attention
				whatever to such absurd and disgusting stories about a
				righteous and pure person like the Holy Prophet. This was
				precisely the occasion when the reformative Commandments
				pertaining to the law of Hijab or Purdah were first
				enforced in the Islamic society. These reforms were
				introduced in this Surah and complemented a year later in
				Surah An-Nur, when a slander was made on the honor of
				Hadrat Aishah.(For further details, see Introduction to
				Surah An-Nur).
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Domestic Affairs of the Holy Prophet">
			<p>
				There were two other problems which needed attention at
				that time. Though apparently they pertained to the Holy
				Prophet's domestic life, it was necessary to resolve them
				for the domestic and mental peace of the person who was
				exerting every effort to promote the cause of Allah's
				Religion and was day and night absorbed in this great
				mission. Therefore, Allah took these two problems also
				officially in His own hand.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first problem was that economically the Holy Prophet
				at that time was in straitened circumstances. During the
				first four years he had no source of income whatever. In
				4 A.H. after the banishment of the Bani an-Nadir, a
				portion of their evacuated lands was reserved for his use
				by the Command of Allah, but it was not enough for his
				family requirements. On the other hand, the duties of the
				office of Prophethood were so onerous that they were
				absorbing all his energies of the mind and body and heart
				and every moment of his time, and he could not make any
				effort at all for earning his livelihood. In conditions
				such as these when his wives happened to disturb his
				mental peace because of economic hardships he would feel
				doubly strained and taxed.
			</p>
			<p>
				The other problem was that before marrying Hadrat Zainab,
				he had four wives already in the houses: Hadrat Saudah,
				Hadrat Aishah, Hadrat Hafsah, and Hadrat Umm Salamah.
				Hadrat Zainab was his fifth wife. At this the opponents
				raised the objection, and the Muslims also started
				entertaining doubts, that as for others it had been
				forbidden to keep more than four wives at a time, but how
				the Holy Prophet himself had taken a fifth wife also.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Subject Matter and Topics">
			<p>
				These were the questions that were engaging the attention
				of the Holy Prophet and the Muslims at the time Surah
				Al-Ahzab was revealed, and replies to the same form the
				subject matter of this Surah.
			</p>
			<p>
				A perusal of the theme and the background shows that the
				Surah is not a single discourse which was sent down in
				one piece but it consists of several injunctions and
				commandments and discourses, which were sent down, one
				after the other, in connection with the important events
				of the time, and then were put together in one Surah. Its
				following parts stand out clearly distinguished from one
				another:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Verses 1-8 seem to have been sent down before the
					Battle of the Trench. Their perusal, keeping the
					historical background in view, shows that at the
					time of their revelation Hadrat Zaid had already
					divorced Hadrat Zainab. The Holy Prophet was
					feeling the necessity that the concepts and
					customs and superstitions of ignorance concerning
					the adoption of the son should be eradicated, and
					he was also feeling that the delicate and deep
					sentiments the people cherished about the adopted
					relations merely on emotional grounds would not
					be rooted out until he himself took the
					initiative to eradicate the custom practically.
					But at the same time he was hesitant and
					considering seriously that if he married the
					divorced wife of Hadrat Zaid then, the hypocrites
					and the Jews and the mushriks who were already
					bent on mischief would get a fresh excuse to
					start a propaganda campaign against Islam. This
					was the occasion of the revelation of vv. 1-8.
				</li>
				<li>
					In verses 9-27 an appraisal has been made of the
					Battle of the Trench and the raid against the
					Bani Quraizah. This is a clear proof that these
					verses were sent down after these events.
				</li>
				<li>
					The discourse contained in vv. 28-35 consists of
					two parts. In the first part, Allah has given a
					notice to the wives of the Holy Prophet, who were
					being impatient of the straitened circumstances,
					to the effect:"Choose between the world and its
					adornments, and Allah, His Prophet and the
					Hereafter. If you seek the former, you should say
					so openly: you will not be kept back in hardship
					even for a day, but will be sent off gracefully.
					And if you seek the latter, you should cooperate
					with Allah and His messenger and bear patiently."
					In the second part, initial steps were taken
					towards the social reforms whose need was being
					felt by the minds molded in the Islamic pattern
					themselves. In this regard, reform was started
					from the house of the Holy Prophet himself and
					his wives were commanded to avoid behaving and
					conducting themselves in the ways of the pre
					Islamic days of ignorance, to remain in their
					houses with dignity, and to exercise great
					caution in their conversation with the other men.
					This was the beginning of the Commandments of
					Purdah.
				</li>
				<li>
					Verses 36-48 deal with the Holy Prophet's
					marriage with Hadrat Zainab. In this section the
					opponents' objection about this marriage have
					been answered; the doubts that were being created
					in the minds of the Muslims have been removed;
					the Muslims have been acquainted with the Holy
					Prophet's position and status; and the Holy
					Prophet himself has been counseled to exercise
					patience on the false propaganda of the
					disbelievers and the hypocrites.
				</li>
				<li>
					In verse 49 a clause of the law of divorce has
					been laid down. This is a unique verse which was
					sent down on some occasion probably in connection
					with the same events.
				</li>
				<li>
					In verses 50-52 a special regulation of marriage
					has been laid down for the Holy Prophet, which
					points out that he is an exception to the several
					restrictions that have been imposed on the other
					Muslims in regard to marital life.
				</li>
				<li>
					In verses 53-55 the second step was taken towards
					social reform. It consists of the following
					injunctions: Restriction on the other men to
					visit the houses of the Holy Prophet's wives;
					Islamic etiquette concerning visits and
					invitations; the law that only the near relatives
					could visit the holy wives in their houses; as
					for the other men, they could speak to or ask
					them a thing from behind a curtain; the
					injunction that the Holy Prophet's wives were
					forbidden for the Muslims like their mothers; and
					none could marry any of them after him.
				</li>
				<li>
					In verses 56-57 warning was given to stop
					criticizing the Holy Prophet's marriage and his
					domestic life, and the believers instructed not
					to indulge in fault finding like the enemies of
					Islam, but to invoke the blessings of Allah for
					their Prophet; moreover, they were instructed
					that they should avoid falsely accusing one
					another even among themselves, not to speak of
					the person of the Prophet.
				</li>
				<li>
					In verse 59 the third step for social reform was
					taken. All the Muslim women were commanded that
					they should come out well covered with the outer
					garments and covering their faces whenever they
					came out of their houses for a genuine need.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				After this till the end of the Surah the hypocrites and
				other foolish and mean people have been rebuked for the
				propaganda that they were carrying on at that time
				against Islam and the Muslims.

				The Surah takes its name from verse 15 in which the word

				which mention has been made of Saba (i. e. the Sabaeans).

		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				The exact period of its revelation is not known from any
				reliable tradition. However, the style shows that it is
				either the middle or the early Makkan period. If it is
				the middle period, it was probably its initial stage when
				the persecution had not yet become tyrannical and the
				Islamic movement was being suppressed only by resort to
				derision and ridicule, rumor mongering, false allegations
				and casting of evil suggestions in the people's minds.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				The Surah deals with those objections of the
				disbelievers, which they were raising against the Holy
				Prophet's message of Tauhid and the Hereafter, and about
				his Prophethood itself, mostly in the form of absurd
				allegations and taunts and mockery. These objections have
				been answered, sometimes by citing them and sometimes
				without citing them, and the discourse itself shows which
				objection is being answered at a particular place. The
				answers mostly take the form of instruction and
				admonition and argument, but at some places the
				disbelievers have been warned also of the evil
				consequences, of their stubbornness. In this connection,
				the stories of the Sabaeans and the Prophets David and
				Solomon have been related to impress this lesson: "You
				have both these historical precedents before you. On the
				one hand, there were the Prophets David and Solomon, who
				had been blessed by Allah with great powers and such
				grandeur and glory as had been granted to hardly any
				people before them. In spite of this, they were not proud
				and arrogant, but remained grateful servants of their
				Lord. They were never rebellious. On the other hand,
				there were the people of Saba, who, when blessed by
				Allah, became proud, and were consequently so thoroughly
				destroyed and dispersed as to be remembered only in myths
				and legends. With these precedents in view, you may see
				and judge for yourselves as to which kind of the life is
				better: that which is built on belief in Tauhid and the
				Hereafter and the attitude of gratefulness to Allah, or
				that which is based on disbelief and shirk and denial of
				the Hereafter and the worship of the world."

		<section heading="Period of Revelation">

				The internal evidence of the style shows that the period
				of the revelation of this Surah is probably the middle
				Makkan period, and especially that part of it, when
				antagonism had grown quite strong and every sort of
				mischief was being adopted to frustrate the mission of
				the Holy Prophet.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Subject Matter and Theme">
			<p>
				The discourse is meant to warn and reprove the people of
				Makkah and their chiefs for their antagonistic attitude
				that they had then adopted towards the Holy Prophet's
				message of Tauhid, like a well wisher, and also to
				admonish them like a teacher, as if to say: "O foolish
				people, the way to which this Prophet is calling you is
				to your own advantage. Your anger, your tricks and
				machinations against it and your conspiracies and designs
				to frustrate it are not directed against him but against
				your own selves. If you do not listen to him, you will be
				harming your own selves, not him. Just consider and
				ponder over what he says: there is nothing wrong in it.
				He repudiates shirk. If you look around carefully, you
				will yourself realize that there is no basis for shirk in
				the world. He presents the doctrine of Tauhid. If you use
				your common sense, you will come to the conclusion that
				there is no being, beside Allah, Creator of the Universe,
				which might possess divine attributes and powers and
				authority. He tells you that you have not been created to
				be irresponsible in this world, but you have to render an
				account of your deeds before your God, and that there is
				life after the life of this world when everyone will meet
				the consequences of what he has done here. If you think a
				little you will see that your doubts and your
				astonishment about it are absolutely baseless. Don't you
				see the phenomenon of the reproduction of creation day
				and night. How can then your own recreation be impossible
				for that God Who created you from an insignificant sperm
				drop? Doesn't your own intellect testify that the good
				and the evil cannot be alike? Then think and judge for
				yourselves as to what is reasonable : should the good and
				the evil meet with the same fate and end up in the dust,
				or should the good be requited with good and the evil
				with evil? Now, if you do not admit and acknowledge these
				rational and reasonable things and do not abandon your
				false gods, and wish to continue living only as
				irresponsible people in the world, the Prophet will not
				lose anything. It is you yourselves only who will suffer
				the consequences. The Prophet's only responsibility was
				to make the truth plain to you, which he has done".
			</p>
			<p>
				In this connection, the Holy Prophet has been consoled
				again and again, as if to say: "When you are doing full
				justice to the preaching of your mission, you do not
				incur any responsibility for those who persist in their
				error and do not accept and follow the right way".
				Furthermore, he has also been consoled to the effect "You
				should neither grieve on account of those who do not want
				to believe, nor consume yourself with the thought of how
				to bring them to the rights path. Instead of this, you
				should pay your full attention to those who are inclined
				to listen to you".
			</p>
			<p>
				The believers also, in this connection, have been given
				the good news so that they may feel strengthened and
				encouraged and remain steadfast on the path of the truth
				with full faith in the promises made by Allah.

				A study of the style shows that it was either sent down
				during the last stage of the middle Makkan period, or it
				is one of those Surahs, which were sent down during the
				last stage of the Holy Prophet's stay at Makkah.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Subject Matter and Theme">
			<p>
				The object of the discourse is to warn the Quraish of the
				consequences of not believing in the Prophethood of
				Muhammad (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him)
				and of resisting and opposing it with tyranny, ridicule
				and mockery. The aspect of the warning is dominant and
				conspicuous although along with repeatedly giving the
				warnings, arguments also have been given for the correct
				understanding by the people.
			</p>
			<p>
				Arguments have been given for three things: 
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					For tauhid, from the signs of the universe and
					from common sense; 
				</li>
				<li>
					For the Hereafter, from the signs of the
					universe, from common sense and from man's own
					existence itself; 
				</li>
				<li>
					For the Prophethood of the Prophet Muhammad, from
					the fact that he was facing all kinds of
					hardships in the preaching of his message without
					any selfish motive, and from this that whatever
					he was inviting the people to was rational and
					reasonable, accepting which was in the people's
					own interest.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				On the strength of these arguments, themes of
				reprobation, reproof and warning have been presented
				repeatedly in a highly forceful manner, so that hearts
				are shaken up and those which have any capacity for
				accepting the truth left in them should not remain
				unmoved.
			</p>
			<p>
				Imam Ahmad, Abu Daud, Nasai, Ibn Majah and Tabarani have
				related on the authority of Hadrat Ma'qil bin Yasar that
				the Holy Prophet said: "Surah Ya Sin is the heart of the
				Quran." This is similar to describing the Surah Al
				Fatihah as the Umm al Quran (the essence or core of the
				Quran), because Al Fatihah contains the sum and substance
				of the teaching of the whole Quran. The Surah Ya Sin has
				been called the throbbing heart of the Quran because it
				presents the message of the Quran in a most forceful
				manner, which breaks the inertness and stirs the spirit
				of man to action.
			</p>
			<p>
				Again Imam Ahmad, Aba Da'ud and Ibn Majah have related
				from the same Ma'qil bin Yasar that the Holy Prophet
				said: "Recite Surah Ya Sin to the dying ones among you."
				The object is not only to revive and refresh the whole
				Islamic creed in the mind of the dying person but also
				bring before him, in particular, a complete picture of
				the Hereafter so that he may know what stages he would
				have to pass through after crossing the stage of this
				worldly life. In view of this, it would be desirable that
				along with the recitation of the Surah Ya Sin its
				translation also is made for the benefit of the person
				who does not know Arabic so that the purpose of the
				admonition is duly fulfilled.

				The subject matter and the style show that this Surah

				The disbelievers of Makkah have been severely warned for
				their attitude of mockery and derision with which they
				were responding to the Holy Prophet's message of Tauhid
				and the Hereafter and for their utter refusal to accept
				and acknowledge his claim to Prophethood. In the end,
				they have been plainly warned that the Prophet whom they
				are mocking and ridiculing will overwhelm them in spite
				of their power and pelf and they will find the army of
				Allah encamping in the very courtyards of their houses
				(vv. 171-179. This notice was given at a time when there
				appeared no chance whatever of the Holy Prophet's success
				and triumph. The Muslims (who have been called Allah's
				army in these verses) were being made the target of
				severe persecution. Three- fourths of their population
				had already emigrated and hardly 40 to 50 of the
				Companions were left with the Holy Prophet in Makkah who
				were experiencing all sorts of the excesses with utter
				helplessness. Under such circumstances, in view of the
				apparent conditions, no one could believe that the Holy
				Prophet and the handful of his ill equipped Companions
				would ultimately attain dominance. The people rather
				thought that the new movement would end and be buried in
				the ravines of Makkah. But hardly 15 to 16 years had
				passed when on the conquest of Makkah precisely the same
				thing happened of which the disbelievers had been
				forewarned. Along with administering warnings, Allah in
				this Surah has done full justice also to the theme of
				inducement and instruction in a balanced way. Brief but
				impressive arguments have been given about the validity
				of the doctrines of Tauhid and the Hereafter. Criticism
				has been made of the creed of the mushrikin to show the
				absurdity of their beliefs; they have been informed of
				the evil consequences of their deviations, which have
				been contrasted with the splendid results of the faith
				and righteous acts. Then, in continuation of the same,
				Precedents from past history have been cited to show how
				Allah had been treating His Prophets and their followers:
				how He has been favoring His faithful servants and
				punishing their deniers and rejecters.
			</p>
			<p>
				The most instructive of the historical narratives
				presented in this Surah is the important event of the
				pious life of the Prophet Abraham, who became ready to
				sacrifice his only son as soon as he received an
				inspiration from Allah. In this there was a lesson not
				only for the disbelieving Quraish, who waxed proud of
				their blood relationship with him, but also for the
				Muslims who had believed in Allah and His Messenger. By
				narrating this event they were told what is the essence
				and the real spirit of Islam, and how a true believer
				should be ready to sacrifice his all for the pleasure and
				approval of Allah after he has adopted it as his Faith
				and Creed.
			</p>
			<p>
				The last verses of the Surah were not only a warning for
				the disbelievers but also a good news for the believers
				who were passing through highly unfavorable and
				discouraging conditions on account of their supporting
				and following the Holy Prophet. In these verses they were
				given the good news that they should not be disheartened
				at the hardships and difficulties they had to encounter
				in the beginning, for in the end they alone would attain
				dominance, and the standard bearers of falsehood, who
				appeared to be dominant at the time would be overwhelmed
				and vanquished at their hands. A few years later the turn
				the events took, proved that it was not an empty
				consolation but an inevitable reality of which they had
				been foretold in order to strengthen their hearts.

				As will be explained below, according to some traditions
				this Surah was sent down in the period when the Holy
				Prophet had started calling the people openly to Islam in
				Makkah, and this had caused great alarm among the chiefs
				of the Quraish. If this be true, its period of revelation
				would be about the 4th year of the Prophethood. According
				to some other traditions, it was sent down after Hadrat
				Umar's embracing Islam, and this happened, as is well
				known, after the migration to Habash. Another chain of
				the traditions shows that the event which occasioned the
				revelation of this Surah took place during the last
				illness of Abu Talib. If this be correct, the period of
				its revelation would be the 10th or 11th year of the
				Prophethood.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Historical Background">
			<p>
				Here is a resume of the traditions related by Imam Ahmad,
				Nasai, Tirmidhi, Ibn Jarir, Ibn Abi Shaibah, Ibn Aba
				Hatim, Muhammad bin Ishaq and others:
			</p>
			<p>
				When Abu Talib fell ill, and the Quraish chiefs knew that
				his end was near, they held consultations and decided to
				approach the old chief with the request that he should
				solve the dispute between them and his nephew. For they
				feared that if Abu Talib died and then they subjected
				Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) to a harsh
				treatment, after his death, the Arabs would taunt them,
				saying, "They were afraid of the old chief as long as he
				lived now that he is dead they have started maltreating
				his nephew." At least 25 of the Quraish chiefs including
				Abu Jahl, Abu Sufyan, Umayyah bin Khalaf, As bin Wa'il,
				Aswad bin al-Muttalib, 'Uqbah bin Abi Mu'ait, Utbah and
				Shaibah went to Abu Talib. First, they put before him
				their complaints against the Holy Prophet as usual, then
				said, "We have come to present before you a just request
				and it is this: let your nephew leave us to our religion,
				and we shall leave him to his. He may worship whomever he
				may please: we shall not stand in his way in this matter;
				but he should not condemn our gods, and should not try to
				force us to give them up. Please tell him to make terms
				with us on this condition". Abu Talib called the Holy
				Prophet and said, "Dear nephew, these people of your
				tribe have come to me with a request. They want you to
				agree with them on a just matter so as to put an end to
				your dispute with them." Then he told him about the
				request of the chiefs of the Quraish. The Holy Prophet
				replied, "Dear uncle: I shall request them to agree upon
				a thing which, if they accept, will enable them to
				conquer the whole of Arabia and subject the non-Arab
				world to their domination." Hearing this the people were
				first confounded; they did not know how they should turn
				down such a proposal. Then, after they had considered the
				matter, they replied: "You speak of one word: we are
				prepared to repeat ten others like it, but please tell us
				what it is." The Holy Prophet said: La ilaha ill-Allah.
				At this they got up all together and left the place
				saying what Allah has narrated in the initial part of
				this Surah.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Sa'd in his Tabaqat has related this event just as
				cited above, but, according to him, this did not happen
				during Abu Talib's last illness but at the time when the
				Holy Prophet had started preaching Islam openly, and the
				news of the conversion of one person or the other was
				being heard almost daily in Makkah. In those days the
				Quraish chiefs had led several deputations to Abu Talib
				and had asked him to stop Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's
				peace and blessings) from preaching his message, and it
				was with one of those deputations that this conversation
				had taken place.
			</p>
			<p>
				Zamakhshari, Razi, Nisaburi and some other commentators
				say that this deputation went to Abu Talib at the time
				then the chiefs of the Quraish had been upset at Hadrat
				Umar's embracing Islam; but no reference to its basis is
				available in any book of the traditions, nor have these
				commentators cited the source of their this information.
				However, if it be true, it is understandable. For the
				unbelieving Quraish had already been bewildered to see
				that the person who had arisen from among themselves with
				the message of Islam had no parallel in the entire tribe
				as regarded nobility, purity of character, wisdom and
				seriousness. Moreover, his right-hand man and chief
				supporter was a man like Abu Bakr, who was well known in
				and around Makkah as a gentle, righteous and brilliant
				man. Now when they might have seen that a brave and
				resolute man like Umar also had joined them, they must
				have felt that the danger was growing and becoming
				intolerable.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Subject Matter and Topics">
			<p>
				The Surah begins with a review of the aforesaid meeting.
				Making the dialogue between the Holy Prophet and the
				disbelievers the basis, Allah says that the actual reason
				with those people for their denial is not any defect in
				the message of Islam but their own arrogance, jealousy
				and insistence on following the blind. They are not
				prepared to believe in a man from their own clan as a
				Prophet of God and follow him. They want to persist in
				the ideas of ignorance which they have found their
				ancestors following. And when a person exposes this
				ignorance and presents the truth before them, they are
				alarmed and regard it as an oddity, rather as a novel and
				impossible thing. For them the concept of Tauhid and the
				Hereafter is not only an unacceptable creed but also a
				concept which only deserves to be ridiculed and mocked.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, Allah, both in the initial part of the Surah and in
				its last sentences, has precisely warned the
				disbelievers, as if to say, "The man whom you are
				ridiculing today and whose guidance you reject will soon
				overpower you, and the time is not far when in this very
				city of Makkah, where you are persecuting him, he will
				overwhelm you completely." Then describing nine of the
				Prophets, one after the other, with greater details of
				the story of the Prophets David and Solomon; Allah has
				emphasized the point that His Law of Justice is impartial
				and objective, that only the right attitude of man is
				acceptable to Him, that He calls to account and punishes
				every wrongdoer, whoever he be, and that He likes only
				those people who do not persist in wrongdoing but repent
				as soon as they are warned of it, and pass their life in
				the world keeping in mind their accountability in the
				Hereafter.
			</p>
			<p>
				After this, the final end that the obedient servants and
				the disobedient people will meet in the Hereafter, has
				been depicted, and two things have been especially
				impressed on the disbelievers:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					That the leaders and guides whom the ignorant
					people are following blindly in the world, on the
					way of deviation, will have reached Hell even
					before their followers in the Hereafter, and the
					two groups will be cursing each other there; 
				</li>
				<li>
					That the disbelievers will be amazed to see that
					there is no trace whatever in Hell of the
					believers whom they used to regard as
					contemptible in the world and will themselves be
					involved in its torment.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				In conclusion, mention has been made of the story of Adam
				and Iblis (Satan), which is meant to tell the
				disbelieving Quraish that the same arrogance and vanity
				which was preventing them from bowing before Muhammad
				(upon whom be Allah's peace) had prevented Iblis also
				from bowing before Adam. Iblis felt jealous of the high
				rank God had given to Adam and became accursed when he
				disobeyed His Command. Likewise, "You, O people of
				Quraish, are feeling jealous of the high rank God has
				bestowed on Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) and are
				not prepared to obey him whom God has appointed His
				messenger. Therefore, you will be doomed ultimately to
				the same fate as will be met by Satan."

				In verse 10 (wa ardullah-i-wasi atun: and Allah's earth

				The entire Surah is a most eloquent and effective address
				which was given some time before the emigration to
				Habash, in an environment filled with tyranny and
				persecution, ill-will and antagonism, at Makkah. It is a
				sermon whose addressees mainly are the unbelieving
				Quraish, although here and there the believers also have
				been addressed. In it the real aim of the invitation of
				Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings) had
				been enunciated, which is this: Man should adopt Allah's
				servitude sincerely, and should not pollute his God
				worship with the service of any other. Presenting this
				cardinal principle in different ways over and over again,
				the truth of Tauhid and the excellent results of
				accepting it, and the falsehood of shirk and the evil
				consequences of following it, have been explained in a
				most forceful way, and the people exhorted to give up
				their wrong way of life and return to the mercy of their
				Lord. In this very connection, the believers have been
				instructed, as if to say: "If a place has become narrow
				for the worship and service of Allah, His earth is vast:
				you may emigrate to some other place in order to save
				your faith: Allah will reward you for your patience." On
				the other hand, the Holy Prophet has been encouraged, so
				as to say: "Tell the disbelievers plainly that they may
				do whatever they like, but their persecutions and
				tyrannies will never deter you from the way of Islam;
				that they may go on doing their worst to obstruct your
				way, but you will continue to perform your mission in
				spite of the adverse conditions and circumstances."

		<section heading="Background of Revelation">
			<p>
				There are clear indications in the subject matter of this
				Surah to the conditions in which it was revealed. The
				disbelievers of Makkah at that time were engaged in two
				kinds of the activities against the Holy Prophet. First,
				they were creating every kind of suspicion and misgiving
				in the minds of the people about the teaching of the
				Quran and the message of Islam and about the Holy Prophet
				himself by starting many disputes and discussions,
				raising irrelevant objections and bringing ever new
				accusations so that the Holy Prophet and the believers
				were sick of trying to answer them. Second, they were
				preparing the ground for putting an end to the Holy
				Prophet himself. They were devising one plot after the
				other, and on one occasion had even taken the practical
				steps to execute a plot. Bukhari has related a tradition
				on the authority of Hadrat Abdullah bin Amr bin 'As
				saying that one day when the Holy Prophet was offering
				his Prayer in the precincts of the Kaabah, suddenly
				'Uqbah bin Abi Mu'ait, rushed forward and putting a piece
				of cloth round his neck started twisting it so as to
				strangle him to death. Hadrat Abu Bakr, who happened to
				go there in time, pushed him away. Hadrat Abdullah says
				that when Abu Bakr was struggling with the cruel man, he
				was saying words to the effect: "Would you kill a man
				only because he says: Allah is my Lord?" With a little
				variation this event has also been mentioned in Ibn
				Hisham, Nasa'i and Ibn Abi Hatim.

				As an answer to the conspiracies of murder, the story of
				the Believer of the people of Pharaoh has been
				acknowledge the prophethood of Muhammad (upon whom be
				Allah's peace), your power and authority will come to an
				end. That is why you are straining every nerve to
				frustrate and defeat him." In the same connection, the
				disbelievers have been warned again and again to the
				effect: "If you do not desist from wrangling against the
				Revelations of Allah, you will be doomed to the same fate
				as the nations of the past. Much worse torment awaits you
				in the Hereafter. Then you will repent, but it will be
				too late."

				The name of this Surah is composed of two words, Ha-Mim
				and As-Sajdah, which implies that it is a Surah which
				begins with Ha-Mim and in which a verse requiring the
				performance of sajdah (prostration) has occurred.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				According to authentic Traditions, it was sent down after
				the affirmation of the Faith by Hadrat Hamzah and before
				the affirmation of the Faith by Hadrat Umar. Muhammad bin
				Ishaq, the earliest biographer of the Holy Prophet, has
				related on the authority of Muhammad bin Ka'b al-Qurzi,
				the famous follower of the Companions, that one day some
				of the Quraish chiefs were sitting in their assembly in
				the Masjid al-Haram, while in another corner of the
				Mosque there was the Holy Prophet sitting by himself.
				This was the time when Hadrat Hamzah had already embraced
				Islam and the people of the Quraish were feeling upset at
				the growing numbers of the Muslims. On this occasion,
				Utbah bin Rabi'ah (the father-in-law of Abu Sufyan) said
				to the Quraish chiefs: "Gentlemen, if you like I would go
				and speak to Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and
				blessings) and put before him some proposals; maybe that
				he accepts one of them, to which we may also agree, and
				so he stops opposing us." They all agreed to this, and
				Utbah went and sat by the Holy Prophet. When the Holy
				Prophet turned to him, he said: "Nephew, you know the
				high status that you enjoy in the community by virtue of
				your ancestry and family relations, but you have put your
				people to great trouble: you have created divisions among
				them and you consider them to be fools: you talk ill of
				their religion and gods, and say things as though all our
				forefathers were pagans. Now listen to me and I shall
				make some suggestions. Consider them well: maybe that you
				accept one of them." The Holy Prophet said: "Abul Walid,
				say what you want to say and I shall listen to you." He
				said, "Nephew, if by what you are doing, you want wealth,
				we will give you enough of it so that you will be the
				richest man among us; if you want to became an important
				man, we will make you our chief and will never decide a
				matter without you; if you want to be a king, we will
				accept you as our king; and if you are visited by a jinn,
				whom you cannot get rid of by your own power, we will
				arrange the best physicians and have you treated at our
				own expense." 'Utbah went on speaking in this strain and
				the Holy Prophet went on listening to him quietly. Then
				he said, "Have you said, O Abul Walid, what you had to
				say?" He replied that he had. The Holy Prophet said:
				"Well, now listen to me." Then pronouncing Bismillah ir
				Rehman-ir-Rahim he began to recite this very Surah, and
				Utbah kept on listening to it, putting his hands behind
				his back and leaning on them as he listened. Coming to
				the verse of prostration (v. 38) the Holy Prophet
				prostrated himself; then raising his head, said, "This
				was my reply, O Abul Walid, now you may act as you
				please." Then Utbah arose and walked back towards the
				chiefs, the people saw him from afar, and said: "By God!
				Utbah's face is changed. He does not look the same man
				that he was when he went from here." Then, when he came
				back and sat down, the people asked, "What have you
				heard?" He replied, "By God! I have heard something the
				like of which I had never heard before. By God, it's
				neither poetry, nor sorcery, nor magic. O chiefs of the
				Quraish, listen to what I say and leave this man to
				himself. I think what he recites is going to have its
				effect. If the other Arabs overcome him, you will be
				saved from raising your hand against your brother, and
				the others will deal with him. But if he overcame Arabia,
				his sovereignty would be your sovereignty and his honor
				your honor." Hearing this the chiefs spoke out: "You too,
				O father of Walid, have been bewitched by his tongue."
				Utbah replied, "I have given you my opinion; now you may
				act as you please." (Ibn Hisham, vol. I, pp. 313-314).
			</p>
			<p>
				This story has been narrated by several other
				traditionists also on the authority of Hadrat Jabir bin
				Abdullah in different ways, with a little variation in
				wording. In some traditions it has also been related that
				when during the recitation the Holy Prophet had come to
				verse 13, viz. "If they turn away, say to them: I warn
				you of a thunderbolt the like of which had visited the Ad
				and the Thamud," Utbah had spontaneously placed his hand
				on the Holy Prophet's mouth, and said: "For God's sake,
				have mercy on your people." Afterwards he justified his
				action before the Quraish chiefs, saying: "You know that
				whatever Muhammad says is always fulfilled; therefore, I
				feared lest a torment should descend on us." (For
				details, see Tafsir Ibn Kathir, vol. IV, pp. 90-91; Al
				Bidayah wan-Nihayah, vol. III, p. 62).
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				In the discourse that Allah sent down in response to what
				Utbah said, no attention whatever was paid to the absurd
				proposals that he had made to the Holy Prophet. For what
				he had said was, in fact, an attack on the Holy Prophet's
				intention and his intellect. His assumption was that as
				there was no possibility of his being a Prophet and the
				Quran being Allah's Revelation, inevitably the motive of
				his invitation must either be the desire to obtain wealth
				and political power, or, God forbid, he had lost his
				reason. In the first case, he wanted to make a bargain
				with the Holy Prophet; in the second, he was insulting
				him when he said that the Quraish chiefs would have him
				cured of his madness at their own expense. Obviously,
				when the opponents come down to such absurd things, no
				gentleman would like to answer them, but would ignore
				them and say what he himself had to say.
			</p>
			<p>
				Therefore, ignoring what Utbah said, this Surah makes
				antagonism its subject of discussion, which the
				unbelieving Quraish were showing stubbornly and wickedly
				in order to defeat the message of the Quran. They would
				say to the Holy Prophet, "You may try however hard you
				try: we would not listen to you. We have put coverings on
				our hearts and we have closed our ears. There is a wall
				between you and us, which would never let us meet
				together."
			</p>
			<p>
				They had given a clear notice to the Holy Prophet to the
				effect: "You may continue your mission of inviting the
				people to yourself, but we would go on opposing you as
				hard as we can to frustrate your mission."
			</p>
			<p>
				For this object they had devised the following plan:
				Whenever the Holy Prophet or a follower of his would try
				to recite the Quran before the people, they would at once
				raise such a hue and cry that no one could hear anything.
				They were desperately trying to misconstrue the verses of
				the Quran and spread every kind of misunderstanding among
				the people. They misconstrued everything and found fault
				even with the straightforward things. They would isolate
				words and sentences from their right context, from here
				and there, and would add their own words in order to put
				new meanings on them so as to mislead the people about
				the Quran and the Messenger who presented it.
			</p>
			<p>
				They would raise strange objections a specimen of which
				has been presented in this Surah. They said, "If an Arab
				presents a discourse in Arabic, what could be the miracle
				in it? Arabic is his mother tongue. Anyone could compose
				anything that he pleased in his mother tongue and then
				make the claim that he had received it from God. It would
				be a miracle if the person would suddenly arise and make
				an eloquent speech in a foreign tongue which he did not
				know. Then only could one say that the discourse was not
				of his own composition but a revelation from God."
			</p>
			<p>
				Here is a resume of what has been said in answer to this
				deaf and blind opposition:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					The Quran is most certainly the Word of God,
					which He has sent down in Arabic. The ignorant
					people do not find any light of knowledge in the
					truths that have been presented in it plainly and
					clearly, but the people of understanding are
					seeing this light as well as benefiting by it. It
					is surely Allah's mercy that He has sent down
					this Word for the guidance of man. If a person
					regarded it as an affliction, it would be his own
					misfortune. Good news is for those who benefit by
					it and warning for those who turn away from it.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you have put coverings on your hearts and have
					made yourselves deaf, it is none of the Prophet's
					job to make the one hear who does not want to
					hear, and the one who does not want to understand
					understand forcibly. He is a man like you; he can
					make only those to hear and understand, who are
					inclined to hear and understand.
				</li>
				<li>
					Whether you close down your eyes and ears and put
					coverings on your hearts, the fact, however, is
					that your God is only One God, and you are not
					the servant of any one else. Your stubbornness
					cannot change this reality in any way. If you
					accept this truth and correct your behavior
					accordingly you will do good only to yourselves,
					and if you reject it, you will only be preparing
					your own doom.
				</li>
				<li>
					Do you have any understanding as to whom you
					disbelieve and with whom you associate others in
					divinity? It is with regard to that God Who has
					created this limitless universe, Who is the
					Creator of the earth and heavens, from Whose
					blessings you are benefiting on the earth, and on
					Whose provisions you are being fed and sustained.
					You set up His mean creatures as His associates
					and then you are made to understand the truth you
					turn away in stubbornness.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you still do not believe, then be aware that a
					sudden torment is about to visit you, the like of
					which had visited the Ad and the Thamud, and this
					torment also will not be the final punishment of
					your crimes, but there is in addition the
					accountability and the fire of Hell in the
					Hereafter.
				</li>
				<li>
					Wretched is the man who gets as company such
					satans from among men and jinn, who show him
					nothing but green and pleasant, who make his
					follies seem fair to him, who neither let him
					think aright himself nor let him hear right from
					others. But on the Day of Reckoning when their
					doom overtakes them, each one of them will say
					that if he happened to get hold of those who had
					misled and deceived him in the world, he would
					trample them under his foot.
				</li>
				<li>
					This Quran is an unchangeable Book. You can not
					defeat it by your machinations and falsehoods.
					Whether falsehood comes from the front or makes a
					secret and indirect attack from behind, it cannot
					succeed in refuting it.
				</li>
				<li>
					Today when this Quran is being presented in your
					own language so that you may understand it, you
					say that it should have been sent down in some
					foreign tongue. But had We sent it in a foreign
					tongue for your guidance, you would yourselves
					have called it a joke, as if to say, "What a
					strange thing! The Arabs are being given guidance
					in a non-Arabic language, which nobody
					understands." This means that you, in fact, have
					no desire to obtain guidance. You are only
					inventing ever new excuses for not affirming the
					faith.
				</li>
				<li>
					Have you ever considered that if it became
					established that the Quran was really from Allah,
					then what fate you would meet by denying it and
					opposing it so vehemently as you do?
				</li>
				<li>
					Today you do not believe but soon you will see
					with your own eyes that the message of this Quran
					had pervaded the whole world and you have
					yourselves been overwhelmed by it. Then you will
					come to know that what you were being told was
					the very truth.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Besides giving these answers to the opponents, attention
				has been paid to the problems which the believers and the
				Holy Prophet himself were facing in that environment of
				active resistance. Not to speak of preaching the message
				to others, the believers were even finding it difficult
				to follow the way of the Faith. Any one about whom it
				became known that he had become a Muslim, life would
				become an agony. As against the dreadful combination of
				the enemy and its all pervading power, they were feeling
				utterly helpless and powerless. In this state, in the
				first place, they were consoled and encouraged, as if to
				say: "You are not, in fact, helpless and powerless, for
				any person who believes in God as his Lord and adheres to
				this belief and way of life resolutely, God's angels
				descend on him and help and support him at every stage,
				from the life of this world till the Hereafter." Then
				they were encouraged with the consolation: "The best man
				is he who does good, invites others to God and proclaims
				firmly that he is a Muslim."
			</p>
			<p>
				The question that was vexing the Holy Prophet at that
				time was as to how he should carve out a way of preaching
				his message when he had to face such heavy odds on every
				side. The solution he was given to this question was:
				"Although apparently the obstacles seem to be
				insurmountable, the weapon of good morals and character
				can smash and melt them away. Use this weapon patiently,
				and whenever Satan provokes you and incites you to use
				some other device, seek refuge in Allah."

				It is derived frog the sentence, wa amru-hum shura baina

				which the word shura has occurred.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				Although it could not be known from any authentic
				traditions, yet one feels after a study of its subject
				matter that this Surah might have been sent down
				consecutively after Ha-Mim As Sajdah, for it seems to be,
				in a way, a supplement to it. This will become clear to
				every person who first studies Surah Ha-Mim As Sajdah
				carefully and then goes through this Surah. He will see
				that in that Surah the Quraish chiefs had been taken to
				tack for their deaf and blind opposition so that anyone
				in Makkah and in its out-skirts, who had any sense of
				morality and nobility left in him, should know how
				unreasonably the chiefs of the people were opposing
				Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace), and as against
				them, how serious he was in everything he said, how
				rational was his standpoint and how noble his character
				and conduct. Immediately after that warning this Surah
				was sent down, which did full justice to teaching and
				instruction, and made the truth of the Holy Prophet's
				message plain in such an impressive way that anyone who
				had any element of the love of the truth in him and who
				had not been blinded by the errors of ignorance, could
				not help being influenced by it.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				The discourse begins in a way as if to say: "Why are you
				expressing surprise and amazement at what Our Prophet is
				presenting before you? What he says is not new or
				strange, nor anything novel, which might have been
				presented for the first time in history: that Revelation
				should come down to a man from God and he should be given
				instructions for the guidance of mankind. Allah has been
				sending similar Revelations with similar instructions to
				the former Prophets before this. It is not surprising
				that the Owner of the Universe should be acknowledged as
				Deity and Ruler, but what is strange is that one should
				accept another as divine and deity in spite of being His
				subject and slave. You are being angry with him who is
				presenting Tauhid before you, where as the shirk that you
				are practicing with regard to the Master of the Universe
				is such a grave crime as may cause the heavens to break
				asunder. The angels are amazed at this boldness of yours
				and fear that the wrath of Allah might descend on you any
				moment."
			</p>
			<p>
				After this the people have been told that a person's
				being appointed to Prophethood and his presenting himself
				as a Prophet does not mean that he has been made master
				of the people's destinies and he has come to the world
				with that very claim. Allah has kept the destinies in His
				own hand. The Prophet has come only to arouse the
				heedless and guide the strayed ones to the Right Path. To
				call to account those who do not listen to him and to
				punish or not to punish them is Allah's own
				responsibility, and not part of the Prophet's work.
				Therefore, they should take it out of their head that the
				Prophet has come with a claim similar to those that are
				made by their so called religious guides and saints to
				the effect that he who would not listen to them, or would
				behave insolently towards them, would be burnt to death:
				In this very connection, the people have also been told
				that the Prophet has not come to condemn them but he is
				their well wisher; he is warning them that the way they
				are following will only lead to their own destruction.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, an answer has been given to the question: Why
				didn't Allah make all human beings righteous by birth,
				and why did He allow the difference of viewpoint owing to
				which the people start following each and every way of
				thought and action? The answer given is this: Owing to
				this very fact has it become possible for man to attain
				to the special mercy of Allah, which is not meant for
				other dumb creatures, but is only meant for those endowed
				with power and authority, who should take Allah as Patron
				and Guardian not instinctively but consciously by willing
				choice. Allah supports the man who adopts this way and
				guides and helps him to do good and right and admits him
				into His special mercy. On the contrary, the man who
				misuses his option and makes his patron those who are
				not, in fact, the guardians, and cannot be, are deprived
				of divine mercy. In this connection, it has also been
				made clear that only Allah is the Patron of man and of
				all other creatures. Others are neither the patron nor
				have the power to do full justice to patronage. Man's
				success depends only on this that he should make no
				mistake in choosing a patron for himself by the use of
				his free choice, and should take only Him his Guide Who,
				in reality, is the real Patron.
			</p>
			<p>
				After this, it has been explained what the Din being
				presented by the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be
				Allah's peace) really is :
			</p>
			<p>
				Its primary basis that as Allah Almighty is the Creator,
				Master and real Patron of the Universe and Man, He alone
				is Man's Ruler, He alone has the right to give Man Faith
				(Din) and Law (system of belief and practice) and judge
				the disputes of man and tell what is Truth and what is
				falsehood. No other being has any right whatever to be
				man's lawgiver. In other words, like the natural
				sovereignty, the sovereignty with regard to lawmaking
				also is vested only in Allah. No man or creature, apart
				from Allah, can be the bearer of this sovereignty. And if
				a person does not recognize and accept this Divine rule
				of Allah, it is merely futile for him to recognize the
				natural sovereignty of Allah.
			</p>
			<p>
				On this very basis has Allah ordained a Din (True
				Religion) for Man from the very beginning. It was one and
				the same Religion that was vouchsafed in every age to all
				the Prophets. No Prophet ever founded any separate
				religion of his own. The same one Religion has been
				enjoined by Allah for all Mankind since the beginning of
				creation, and all the Prophets have been following it and
				inviting others to follow it.
			</p>
			<p>
				This Religion and Creed was not sent so that man may rest
				content only with believing in it, but it was sent with
				the purpose and intention that it alone should be
				introduced, established and enforced in the world, and no
				man made religion be made to prevail in Allah's earth
				apart from His Religion. The Prophets had not been
				appointed only to preach this Religion but to establish
				it particularly in the world.
			</p>
			<p>
				This same was the original Religion of mankind, but after
				the death of the Prophets, selfish people created new
				creeds by creating schisms for vested interests due to
				self-conceit, vanity and ostentation. All the different
				religions and creeds found in the world today have
				resulted from corruption of the original Divine Truth.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's
				peace,) has been sent so that he may present before the
				people the same and original Religion in place of the
				various practices and artificial creeds and man made
				religions, and may try to establish the same. On this, if
				instead of being grateful, you feel angry and come out to
				fight him, it is your folly; the Prophet will not abandon
				his mission only because of your foolishness. He has been
				enjoined to adhere to his faith at all costs and to carry
				out the mission to which he has been appointed.
				Therefore, the people should not cherish any false hope
				that in order to please them he would cater to the same
				whims and superstitions of ignorance which has corrupted
				Allah's Religion before.
			</p>
			<p>
				You do not understand how great an impudence it is
				against Allah to adopt a man made religion and law
				instead of the Religion and Law enjoined by Allah. You
				think it is an ordinary thing and there is nothing wrong
				with it. But in the sight of Allah it is the worst kind
				of shirk and a grave crime whose punishment will be
				imposed on all those who enforced their own religion on
				Allah's earth and those who adopted and followed their
				religion.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thus, after presenting a clear and visible concept of
				Religion it is said: "The best possible method that could
				be employed for your instruction and for bringing you to
				the Right Path has already been employed. On the one
				hand, Allah has sent down His Book, which is teaching you
				the truth in a most impressive way in your own language;
				and on the other, the lives of the Holy Prophet Muhammad
				(upon whom be Allah's peace) and his Companions are
				present before you by which you can see for yourselves
				what kind of men are prepared by the guidance given in
				this Book. Even then if you do not accept this guidance,
				nothing else in the world can bring you to the Right
				Path. The only alternative, therefore, is that you should
				be allowed to persist in the same error in which you have
				remained involved for centuries, and made to meet with
				the same doom which has been destined by Allah for such
				wrongdoers."
			</p>
			<p>
				While stating these truths, brief arguments have been
				given, here and there, for Tauhid and the Hereafter, the
				world worshipers have been warned of the evil
				consequences and their punishment in the life hereafter,
				and the disbelievers have been criticized for the moral
				weaknesses, which were the real cause of their deviation
				from the truth. The Surah has been concluded with two
				important themes.
			</p>
			<p>
				First, that the Holy Prophet was wholly unaware of this
				concept of the "Book" or the True Faith during the first
				forty years of his life and then his sudden appearance
				before the people with those two things, is a manifest
				proof of his being a Prophet.
			</p>
			<p>
				Secondly, his presenting his own teaching as the teaching
				of God does not mean that he claims to have spoken to
				God, face to face, but God has conveyed to him this
				Guidance, as in the case of all other Prophets, in three
				ways: He speaks to His Prophets either through
				Revelation, or from behind a veil, or He sends an angel
				with the message. This thing was clarified so that the
				opponents did not have an opportunity of accusing the
				Holy Prophet of claiming to have spoken to God, face to
				face, and the lovers of the truth should know by what
				methods Allah gave instruction to the man whom He had
				appointed to the mission of Prophethood.

	<sura num="43">
		<section heading="Name">
			<p>
				It is derived from the word zukhruf-an which occurs in
				verse 33 of this Surah.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				It could not be known from any authentic tradition, but a
				study of its subject matter shows that this Surah also
				was sent down in the same period in which the Surahs Al
				Mumin, As Sajdah and Ash Shura, were sent down. It
				appears that the revelation of this series of the Surahs
				began when the disbelievers of Makkah were planning to
				put an end to the Holy Prophet's life. Day and night they
				were holding consultations in their assemblies as how to
				eliminate him, and even an attack on his life also had
				been made as has been clearly referred to in vv. 79-80.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Topics">
			<p>
				In this Surah a forceful and severe criticism has been
				made of the Quraish and the common Arabs creeds and
				superstitions of ignorance in which they persisted, and
				their stubbornness has been exposed in a firm and
				effective way, so that every member of the society, who
				was reasonable in some degree, should be made to consider
				the evils in which the community was involved and its
				tyrannical treatment of the person who was trying to
				redeem it.
			</p>
			<p>
				The discourse starts in a way as if to say: "You, by
				means of your mischiefs, want that the revelation of this
				Book should be stopped, but Allah has never withheld the
				appointment of His Prophets and the revelation of His
				Books because of the mischief of the people, but has
				destroyed the wicked people, who obstructed the way of
				His guidance. The same He will do again. A little further
				in vv. 41-43 and 79-80 the same thing has been
				reiterated. Though the people who were plotting against
				his life are meant, the Holy Prophet has been addressed
				to the effect: "whether you remain alive or not, We will
				certainly punish the wicked," and the people themselves
				have been plainly warned to the effect: "If you have
				decided to take an action against Our Prophet, We too
				will take a decisive action."
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, it has been told what is the reality of the
				religion that the people are following so devotedly and
				what are the arguments on whose strength they are
				resisting Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and
				Blessings).
			</p>
			<p>
				They themselves admit that the Creator of the earth and
				heavens and of themselves and their deities is only
				Allah. They also know and admit that the blessings they
				are benefiting from, have been bestowed by Allah; yet
				they insist on making others associates of Allah in His
				Godhead. They regard the servants as the children of
				Allah, and that too daughters, whom they regard as
				disgraceful for themselves.
			</p>
			<p>
				They believe that the angels are goddesses; they have
				carved their images as females; they adorn them with
				female dresses and ornaments, and call them daughters of
				Allah: they worship them and invoke them for the
				fulfillment of their needs. How did they know that the
				angels were female?
			</p>
			<p>
				When they are rebuked for these superstitions, they
				present the pretense of destiny and say: "Had Allah
				disapproved of these our practices, we could not have
				worshipped these images, whereas the means of finding out
				whether Allah had approved of something or not, are His
				Books and not those things which are happening in the
				world according to His Will. For under His Will not only
				idol worship but crimes like theft and adultery, robbery,
				murder, etc. also are being committed. Can this argument
				be used to justify as right and proper this commission of
				every crime and evil in the world?
			</p>
			<p>
				When it is asked:Have you any other authority, apart from
				this wrong argument, for the polytheism of yours? They
				reply, "The same has been the practice since the time of
				our forefathers." In other words, this in their opinion
				is a strong enough argument for a creed's being right and
				true, whereas the Prophet Ibrahim, descent from whom is
				the only basis of their pride and distinction, had
				rejected the religion of his elders and left his home,
				and he had discarded every such blind imitation of his
				forefathers, which did not have the support of any
				rational argument. Then, if these people had to follow
				their elders only, for this also they selected their most
				ignorant elders and abandoned their most illustrious
				elders like the Prophets Abraham and Ishmael (on whom be
				peace).
			</p>
			<p>
				When they are asked: "Has ever a Prophet or a Book sent
				down by God also given this teaching that others beside
				Allah too are worthy of worship? they present this
				practice of the Christians as an argument that they took
				Jesus son of Mary as son of God and worshipped him;
				whereas the question was not whether the community of a
				Prophet had committed shirk or not, but whether a Prophet
				had himself taught shirk. Jesus son of Mary had never
				said that he was son of God and that the people should
				worship him. His own was the same teaching which every
				other Prophet had given: "My Lord as well as your Lord is
				Allah: so worship Him alone."
			</p>
			<p>
				They were disinclined to believe in the Prophethood of
				the Holy Prophet because he was neither a rich man nor a
				person of high worldly position and rank. They said "Had
				Allah willed to appoint a prophet among us, He would have
				appointed one of the great men of our two cities (Makkah
				and Taif). On that very basis, Pharaoh also had looked
				down upon the Prophet Moses and said: "If Allah, the King
				of the heavens, had to send a messenger to me, the king
				of the earth, He would have sent him with bracelets of
				gold and a company of angels in attendance. Wherefrom has
				this mendicant appeared? I am superior to him, for the
				kingdom of Egypt belongs to me, and the canals of the
				River Nile are flowing under my control. What is the
				status of this man as against me? He has neither wealth
				nor authority."
			</p>
			<p>
				Thus, after criticizing each practice of ignorance of the
				disbelievers and rejecting it with rational arguments, it
				has been pointed out: "Neither has God any offspring, nor
				are there separate gods of the earth and heavens, nor is
				there any intercessor who may be able to protect from His
				punishment those who adopt deviation knowingly. Allah is
				far above this that He should have children. He alone is
				the God of the whole Universe: all others are His
				servants and not associates in His attributes and powers,
				and only such men can intercede with Him, who are
				themselves followers of the Truth and they also can
				intercede only for those who may have adopted obedience
				of the Truth in the world."

				The Surah takes its name from the word dukhan which
				occurs in verse 10.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				Its period of revelation also could not be determined
				from any authentic tradition, but the internal evidence
				of the subject matter shows that this Surah too was sent
				down in the same period in which Surah Zukhruf and a few
				other earlier Surahs had been revealed. However, this
				Surah was sent down somewhat later. Its historical
				background is this: When the disbelievers of Makkah
				became more and more antagonistic in their attitude and
				conduct, the Holy Prophet prayed: O God, help me with a
				famine like the famine of Joseph. He thought that when
				the people would be afflicted with a calamity, they would
				remember God, their hearts would soften and they would
				accept the admonition. Allah granted his prayer, and the
				whole land was overtaken by such a terrible famine that
				the people were sorely distressed. At last, some of the
				Quraish chiefs among whom Hadrat Abdullah bin Masud has
				particularly mentioned the name of Abu Sufyan came to the
				Holy Prophet and requested him to pray to Allah to
				deliver his people from the calamity. On this occasion
				Allah sent down this Surah.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Subject Matter and Topics">
			<p>
				The introduction to the address revealed on this occasion
				for the admonition and warning of the people of Makkah
				contained some important points, which are as follows:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					"You, O People of Makkah, are wrong in thinking
					that the Quran is being composed by Muhammad
					(upon whom be Allah's peace). This Book by itself
					bears the clear testimony that it is not the
					composition of a man but of Allah, Lord of the
					worlds."
				</li>
				<li>
					"You are making a wrong estimate of the worth of
					this Book. You think it is a calamity that has
					descended on you, whereas the Hour when Allah,
					out of sheer mercy, decided to send His Messenger
					and His Book to you was highly blessed."
				</li>
				<li>
					"You are foolishly involved in the
					misunderstanding that you will fight this
					Messenger and this Book and will win, whereas the
					fact is that the Messenger has been raised and
					the Book sent down in that particular Hour when
					Allah decides the destinies, and Allah's
					decisions are not so weak that they may be
					changed to a person's liking, nor are they based
					on ignorance and folly that there may be the
					likelihood of a mistake or error or weakness in
					them. They are rather the firm and unalterable
					decisions of the Ruler of the Universe, Who is
					All Hearing, All Knowing and All Wise. Therefore,
					they cannot be treated lightly.
				</li>
				<li>
					"You yourselves acknowledge that Allah alone is
					the Master and Lord of the earth and heavens and
					of everything in the Universe and also admit that
					life and death are only in His power, yet you
					insist on making others your deities, for which
					the only argument you offer is that that had been
					the practice since the time of your forefathers,
					whereas if a person has the conviction that Allah
					alone is the Master, Sustainer and Giver of life
					and death, he can never entertain the doubt that
					there can be other gods also beside Him, who can
					be worthy of worship. If your forefathers had
					committed this folly, there is no reason why you
					also should continue committing it blindly. As a
					matter of fact, their Lord too was only One God,
					Who is your Lord, and they also should have
					worshipped only Him, Whom you should worship."
				</li>
				<li>
					"The only demand of Allah's Providence and
					Mercifulness is not this that He should feed you,
					but also this that He should arrange guidance for
					you. For this very guidance He has sent His
					Messenger and His Book."
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				After this introduction, the question of the famine that
				was raging in Makkah has been discussed. As already
				mentioned, this famine had occurred on the Holy Prophet's
				prayer, and he had prayed for it so that when the
				calamity befell it would break the stubbornness of the
				disbelievers and then they would listen to the rebuke. It
				looked as if this expectation was being fulfilled to some
				extent, for some of the most stubborn enemies of the
				Truth, on account of the severity of the famine, had
				cried out: "O Lord, avert this torment from us and we
				will believe." At this, on the one hand, the Holy Prophet
				has been foretold: "These people will not learn any
				lesson from such calamities. When they have turned away
				from the Messenger, whose life, character, works and
				speech clearly show that he is Allah's true Messenger,
				how will a mere famine help remove their disbelief?" On
				the other, the unbelievers have been addressed, so as to
				say : "You lie when you say that you will believe as soon
				as the torment is removed from you. We shall just remove
				it to see how sincere you are in your promise. There is a
				graver disaster about to fall upon you. You need a much
				more crushing blow: minor misfortunes cannot set you
				right."
			</p>
			<p>
				In this very connection, a reference has been made a
				little below to Pharaoh and his people, implying that
				those people also had met with precisely the same trial
				as the chiefs of the disbelieving Quraish are now
				afflicted. To them also a similar noble and honorable
				Messenger had come; they also had seen those express
				pointers and signs which clearly showed that he had been
				appointed by Allah; they also had gone on witnessing one
				sign after the other but they did not give up their
				stubbornness, till at last they made up their mind to put
				an end to the Messenger's life, and they met their doom,
				which has since become an object lesson for the people
				for ever.
			</p>
			<p>
				After this the theme of the Hereafter has been taken up,
				which the disbelievers of Makkah vehemently denied. They
				said: "We have never seen anyone rising back to life
				after death. Raise our forefathers back to life if you
				are true in your claim about the life hereafter." In
				response to this, two arguments for the Hereafter have
				been presented briefly: 
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					That the denial of this creed has always proved
					destructive for the morals
				</li>
				<li>
					That the universe is not a plaything of a
					thoughtless deity, but it is a wise system and no
					work of wisdom is ever vain or useless. 
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Then the disbelievers' demand to bring their forefathers
				back to life has been answered, thus: "This cannot be
				done every day to meet the demand of the individuals, but
				Allah has appointed a time when He will resurrect all
				mankind simultaneously and will subject them to
				accountability in His Court. If one has to protect
				oneself there, one should think about it here. For no one
				will be able to save himself there by his own power, nor
				by the power of any one else."
			</p>
			<p>
				In connection with this Court of Allah, mention has been
				made of the fate of those who will be declared as
				culprits and of the rewards of those who will be declared
				as successful. The discourse has been concluded with this
				warning: "This Quran has been revealed in simple language
				in your own tongue so that you may understand it; yet if
				you do not understand it and insist on seeing your evil
				end, you may wait; Our Prophet too is waiting. Whatever
				is to happen, will happen at its own appointed time."

				It is derived from the sentence wa tartt kullu ummat- in

				Surah in which the word jathiyah has occurred.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				The period of the revelation of this Surah also has not
				been mentioned in any authentic tradition, but its
				subject matter clearly shows that it was revealed
				consecutively after Surah Ad Dukhan. The close
				resemblance between the contents of the two Surahs makes
				them look like the twin Surahs.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Subject Matter and Topics">
			<p>
				It answers the doubts and objections of the disbelievers
				of Makkah about Tauhid and the Hereafter and warns them
				for their attitude that they had adopted against the
				message of the Quran.
			</p>
			<p>
				The discourse begins with the arguments for Tauhid. In
				this connection, reference has been made to the countless
				Signs that are found in the world, from man's own body to
				the earth and heavens, and it is pointed out that
				everywhere around him man finds things which testify to
				tauhid which he refuses to acknowledge. If man sees
				carefully the variety of animals, the day and night, the
				rainfall and the vegetation thereby, the winds and his
				own creation, and ponders over them intelligently,
				without prejudice, he will find these Signs sufficiently
				convincing of the truth that this universe is not
				Godless, nor under the control of many gods, but it has
				been created by One God, and He alone is its Controller
				and Ruler. However, the case of the person who is
				determined not to acknowledge and wants to remain
				involved in doubts and suspicions is different. He cannot
				be blessed with the faith and conviction from anywhere in
				the world.
			</p>
			<p>
				A little below, in the beginning of the second section,
				it has been reiterated that the things man is exploiting
				in the world, and the countless forces and agencies that
				are serving his interests in the universe, did not come
				into being just accidentally, nor have they been provided
				by the gods and goddesses, but it is One God alone, Who
				has supplied and subjected these to him from Himself. If
				only a person uses his mind properly and rightly, his own
				intellect will proclaim that God alone is man's real
				Benefactor and He alone deserves that man should pay
				obeisance to Him.
			</p>
			<p>
				After this, the disbelievers of Makkah have been taken to
				task and reproved for their stubbornness, arrogance,
				mockery and insistence on disbelief with which they were
				resisting the invitation of the Quran; they have been
				warned that this Quran has brought the same blessing
				which had been granted to the children of Israel before,
				by virtue of which they became distinguished above all
				the people of the world. Then, when they failed to
				recognize the true worth of this blessing and disputed
				their religion and lost it, this blessing now has been
				sent to them. This is such a code of guidance which shows
				the clear highway of Religion to man. The people who
				would turn it down by their own folly, would only prepare
				for their own doom, and only such people would become
				worthy of God's succor and mercy who would adopt
				obedience to it and lead a life of piety and
				righteousness.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this connection, the followers of the Holy Prophet
				have been instructed that they should forbear and pardon
				the absurd and foolish behavior towards them of the
				people fearless of God, for if they showed patience God
				Himself would deal with their opponents and would reward
				them for their fortitude.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, there is a criticism of the erroneous ideas that
				the disbelievers hold about the Hereafter. They said that
				life was only this worldly life there was no life
				hereafter. Man dies in the course of time just as a watch
				stops functioning suddenly. The body is not survived by
				any soul, which might be seized and then breathed again
				into the human body some time in the future. In this
				regard, they challenged the Holy Prophet, saying: "If you
				lay a claim to this, then raise our dead forefathers back
				to life." In answer to this, Allah has given the
				following arguments
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					"You do not say this on the basis of any
					knowledge but are uttering this grave thing on
					the basis of conjecture. Do you really have the
					knowledge that there is no other life after
					death, and the souls are not seized but are
					annihilated?"
				</li>
				<li>
					"Your claim rests mainly on this: that you have
					not seen any dead person rising back to life and
					returning to the world. Is this basis strong
					enough for a person to make a claim that the dead
					people will never rise to life?When you do not
					experience and observe a thing, does it mean that
					you have the knowledge that it does not exist at
					all?
				</li>
				<li>
					It is utterly against reason and justice that the
					good and the bad, the obedient and the
					disobedient, the oppressor and the oppressed,
					should be made equal ultimately. Neither a good
					act should bear a good result nor an evil act an
					evil result; neither the grievances of the
					oppressed be redressed nor the oppressor be
					punished, but everyone should meet with the same
					fate ultimately. Whoever has formed this view
					about the universe of God, has formed a patently
					wrong view. The unjust and wicked people adopt
					this view because they do not want to face the
					evil results of their deeds, but this world of
					God is not a lawless kingdom; it is rather a
					system based on the Truth, in which there can be
					no question of the injustice of regarding the
					good and the bad as equal.
				</li>
				<li>
					That the creed of the denial of the Hereafter is
					highly destructive of morals. This is adopted
					only by such people as are the slaves of their
					lusts, and for the reason that they should have
					full freedom to serve their lusts. Then, when
					they have adopted this creed, it goes on making
					them more and more perverse till at last their
					moral sense becomes dead and all avenues of
					guidance are closed against them.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				After giving these arguments Allah says most
				emphatically: "Just as you did not become living of your
				own accord, but became living by Our power, so you do not
				die of your own accord, but die when We send death on
				you. And a time is certainly coming when you will all be
				gathered together. If you do not believe in this because
				of your ignorance and folly today, you may not; when the
				time arrives, you will see for yourself that you are
				present before your God and your whole book of conduct is
				ready accurately, which bears evidence against each of
				your misdeeds. Then you will come to know how dearly has
				your denial of the Hereafter and your mockery of it cost
				you."

	<sura num="46">
		<section heading="Name">
			<p>
				It is derived from the sentence idh andhara qauma-hu bil
				Ahqaf-i of verse 21.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				It is determined by an historical event that has been
				mentioned in vv. 29-32. This incident of the visit of the
				jinn and their going back after listening to the Quran
				had occurred, according to agreed traditions of the
				Hadith and biographical literature, at the time when the
				Holy Prophet had halted at Makkah during his return
				journey from Ta'if to Makkah. And according to all
				authentic historical traditions he had gone to Ta'if
				three years before the Hijrah; therefore it is determined
				that this Surah was sent down towards the end of the 10th
				year or in the early part of the 11th year of the
				Prophethood.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Historical Background">
			<p>
				The 10th year of the Prophethood was a year of extreme
				persecution and distress in the Holy prophet's life. The
				Quraish and the other tribes had continued their boycott
				of the Bani Hashim and the Muslims for three years and
				the Holy Prophet and the people of his family and
				Companions lay besieged in Shi'b Abi Talib. The Quraish
				had blocked up this locality from every side so that no
				supplies of any kind could reach the besieged people.
				Only during the Hajj season they were allowed to come out
				and buy some articles of necessity. But even at that time
				whenever Abu Lahab noticed any of them approaching the
				market place or a trading caravan he would call out to
				the merchants exhorting them to announce forbidding rates
				of their articles for them, and would pledge that he
				himself would buy those articles so that they did not
				suffer any loss. This boycott which continued
				uninterrupted for three years had broken the back of the
				Muslims and the Bani Hashim; so much so that at times
				they were even forced to eat grass and the leaves of
				trees.
			</p>
			<p>
				At last, when the siege was lifted this year, Abu Talib,
				the Holy Prophet's uncle, who had been shielding him for
				ten long years, died, and hardly a month later his wife,
				Hadrat Khadijah, who had been a source of peace and
				consolation for him ever since the beginning of the call,
				also passed away. Because of these tragic incidents,
				which closely followed each other, the Holy Prophet used
				to refer to this year as the year of sorrow and grief.
			</p>
			<p>
				After the death of Hadrat Khadijah and Abu Talib the
				disbelievers of Makkah became even bolder against the
				Holy Prophet. They started treating him even more
				harshly. So much so that it became difficult for him to
				step out of his house. Of these days Ibn Hisham has
				related the incident that a Quraish scoundrel one day
				threw dust at him openly in the street.
			</p>
			<p>
				At last, the Holy Prophet left for Ta'if with the
				intention that he should invite the Bani Thaqif to Islam,
				for even if they did not accept Islam, they might at
				least be persuaded to allow him to work for his mission
				peacefully. He did not have the facility of any
				conveyance at that time, and traveled all the way to
				Ta'if on foot. According to some traditions, he had gone
				there alone, but according to others, he was accompanied
				by Zaid bin Harithah. He stayed at Ta'if for a few days,
				and approached each of the chiefs and nobles of the Bani
				Thaqif and talked to him about his mission. But not only
				they refused to listen to him, but plainly gave him the
				notice that he should leave their city, for they feared
				that his preaching might "spoil" their younger
				generation. Thus, he was compelled to leave Ta'if. When
				he was leaving the city, the chiefs of Thaqif set their
				slaves and scoundrels behind him, who went on crying at
				him, abusing him and petting him with stones for a long
				way from either side of the road till he became broken
				down with wounds and his shoes were filled with blood.
				Wearied and exhausted he took shelter in the shade of the
				wall of a garden outside Ta'if, and prayed:
			</p>
			<p>
				"O God, to Thee I complain of my weakness, little
				resource, and lowliness before men. O Most Merciful, Thou
				art the Lord of the weak, and Thou art my Lord. To whom
				wilt Thou confide me? To one afar who will misuse me? Or
				to an enemy to whom Thou hast given power over me? If
				Thou art not angry with me I care not. Thy favor is more
				wide for me. I take refuge in the light of Thy
				countenance by which the darkness is illumined, and the
				things of this world and the next are rightly ordered,
				lest Thy anger descend upon me or Thy wrath light upon
				me. It is for Thee to be satisfied until Thou art well
				pleased. There is no power and no might save in Thee."
				(Ibn Hisham: A. Guillaume's Translation, p. 193).
			</p>
			<p>
				Grieved and heartbroken when he returned and reached near
				Qarn al-Manazil, he felt as though the sky was overcast
				by clouds. He looked up and saw Gabriel in front of him,
				who called out: "Allah has heard the way your people have
				responded. He has, therefore, sent this angel in charge
				of the mountains. You may command him as you please."
				Then the angel of the mountains greeted him and submitted
				: "If you like I would overturn the mountains from either
				side upon these people." The Holy Prophet replied : "No,
				but I expect that Allah will create from their seed those
				who will worship none but Allah, the One." (Bukhari,
				Dhikr al Mala'ikah; Muslim: Kitab al-Maghazi; Nasa'i
				:Al-Bauth).
			</p>
			<p>
				After this he went to stay for a few days at Makkah,
				perplexed as to how he would face the people of Makkah,
				who, he thought, would be still further emboldened
				against him after hearing what had happened at Ta'if. It
				was here that one night when he was reciting the Quran in
				the Prayer, a group of the jinn happened to pass by and
				listened to the Quran, believed in it, and returned to
				their people to preach Islam. Thus, Allah gave His
				Prophet the good news that if the men were running away
				from his invitation, there were many of the jinn, who had
				become its believers, and they were spreading his message
				among their own kind.

				Such were the conditions when this Surah was sent down.
				Anyone who keeps this background in view, on the one
				hand, and studies this Surah, on the other, will have no
				doubt left in his mind that this is not at all the
				composition of Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace), but
				"a Revelation from the All Mighty, All Wise Allah." For
				nowhere in this Surah, from the beginning to the end,
				does one find even a tinge of the human feelings and
				reactions, which are naturally produced in a man who is
				passing through such hard conditions. Had it been the
				word of Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) whom the
				occurrence of personal griefs one after the other and the
				countless and the recent bitter experience at Ta'if had
				caused extreme anguish and distress, it would have
				reflected in some degree the state of the mind of the man
				who was the subject of these afflictions and griefs.
				Consider the prayer that we have cited above: it contains
				his own language, its every word is saturated with the
				feelings that he had at the time. But this Surah which
				was sent down precisely in the same period and was
				recited even by him under the same conditions, is
				absolutely free from every sign or trace of the time.
			</p>
			<p>
				The subject matter of the Surah is to warn the
				disbelievers of the errors in which they were involved,
				and also persisted arrogantly, and were condemning the
				man who was trying to redeem them. They regarded the
				world as a useless and purposeless place where they were
				not answerable to anyone. They thought that invitation to
				Tauhid was false and stuck to the belief that their own
				deities were actually the associates of Allah. They were
				not inclined to believe that the Quran was the Word of
				the Lord of the worlds. They had a strange erroneous
				concept of apostleship on the basis of which they were
				proposing strange criteria of judging the Holy Prophet's
				claim to it. In their estimation one great proof of
				Islam's not being based on the truth was that their
				elders and important chiefs of the tribes and so called
				leaders of their nation were not accepting it and only a
				few young men, and some poor folks and some slaves had
				affirmed faith in it. They thought that Resurrection and
				life after death and the rewards and punishments of the
				Hereafter were fabrications whose occurrence was
				absolutely out of the question.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this Surah each of these misconceptions has been
				refuted in a brief but rational way, and the disbelievers
				have been warned that if they would reject the invitation
				of the Quran and the Prophethood of the Prophet Muhammad
				(upon whom be Allah's peace) by prejudice and
				stubbornness instead of trying to understand its truth
				rationally, they would only be preparing for their own
				doom.

				The contents of this Surah testify that it was sent down
				after the hijrah at Madinah at the time when the fighting
				had been enjoined, though active fighting had not yet
				been undertaken. Detailed arguments in support of this
				view have been given in E. N. 8 below.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Historical Background">
			<p>
				The conditions at the time when this Surah was sent down
				were such that the Muslims were being made the target of
				persecution and tyranny in Makkah in particular and in
				Arabia in general, and life had become miserable for
				them. Although the Muslims had emigrated to the haven of
				Madinah from every side, the disbelieving Quraish were
				not prepared to leave them alone and let them live in
				peace even there. Thus, the small settlement of Madinah
				was hemmed in by the enemy, who was bent upon
				exterminating it completely. The only alternative left
				with the Muslims were that either they should surrender
				to the forces of ignorance, giving up their mission of
				preaching the true Faith, or even following it in their
				private lives, or should rise to wage a war at the cost
				of their lives to settle finally and for ever whether
				Islam would stay in Arabia or the creed of ignorance. On
				this occasion Allah showed the Muslims the same way of
				reso1ution and will, which is the only way for the true
				believers. He first permitted them to fight in Surah Al
				Hajj 39 and then enjoined fighting in Al Baqarah 190. But
				at that time everyone knew fully well what it meant to
				wage a war in those conditions. There were only a handful
				of Muslims in Madinah, who could not muster even a
				thousand soldiers; yet they were being urged to take up
				the sword and clash against the pagan forces of the whole
				of Arabia. Then the kind of the weapons needed to equip
				its soldiers for war could hardly be afforded by the town
				in which hundreds of emigrants were still homeless and
				unsettled even by resort to starving its members at a
				time when it had been boycotted economically by the Arabs
				on all sides.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				Such were the conditions when this Surah was revealed.
				Its theme is to prepare the believers for war and to give
				them preliminary instructions in this regard. That is why
				it has also been entitled al-Qital. It deals with the
				following topics:
			</p>
			<p>
				At the outset it is said that of the two groups
				confronting each other at this time, one has refused to
				accept the Truth and has become an obstruction for others
				on the way of Allah, while the other group has accepted
				the Truth which had been sent down by Allah to His
				servant, Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and
				blessings). Now, Allah's final decision is that He has
				rendered fruitless and vain all the works of the former
				group and set right the condition and affairs of the
				latter group.
			</p>
			<p>
				After this, the Muslims have been given the initial war
				instructions they have been reassured of Allah's help and
				guidance: they have been given hope for the best rewards
				on offering sacrifices in the cause of Allah and they
				have been assured that their struggle in the cause of the
				Truth will not go to waste, but they will be abundantly
				rewarded both in this world and in the Hereafter.
			</p>
			<p>
				Furthermore, about the disbelievers it has been said that
				they are deprived of Allah's support and guidance: none
				of their designs will succeed in their conflict with the
				believers, and they will meet a most evil fate both in
				this world and in the Hereafter. They thought they had
				achieved a great success by driving the Prophet of Allah
				out of Makkah, but in fact by this they had hastened
				their own doom.
			</p>
			<p>
				After this, the discourse turns to the hypocrites, who
				were posing to be sincere Muslims before the command to
				fight was sent down, but were confounded when this
				command actually came down, and began to conspire with
				the disbelievers in order to save themselves from the
				hazards of war. They have been plainly warned to the
				effect that no act and deed is acceptable to Allah of
				those who adopt hypocrisy with regard to Him and His
				Prophet. There, the basic issue against which all those
				who profess the Faith are being tried is whether one is
				on the side of the Truth or Falsehood, whether one's
				sympathies are with Islam and the Muslims or with
				disbelief and the disbelievers, whether one keeps one's
				own self and interests dearer or the Truth which one
				professes to believe in and follow. One who fails in this
				test is not at all a believer; his Prayer and his Fasting
				and his discharging of the zakat deserve no reward from
				Allah.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then the Muslims have been exhorted not to lose heart for
				being small in numbers and ill equipped as against the
				great strength of the disbelievers: they should not show
				weakness by offering peace to them, which might still
				further embolden them against Islam and the Muslims, but
				they should come out with trust in Allah and clash with
				the mighty forces of disbelief. Allah is with the
				Muslims: they alone shall triumph; and the might of
				disbelief will be humbled and vanquished.
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, the Muslims have been invited to spend
				their wealth in the cause of Allah. Although at that time
				they were economically very weak, the problem that they
				confronted was the very survival of Islam and the
				Muslims. The importance and delicacy of the problem
				demanded that the Muslims should not only risk their
				lives for safeguarding themselves and their Faith from
				the dominance of disbelief and for exalting Allah's
				Religion but should also expend their economic resources
				as far as possible in the preparations for war.
				Therefore, they were clearly warned to the effect: Anyone
				who adopted a niggardly attitude at the time, would not,
				in fact, harm Allah at all, but would result in his own
				destruction, for Allah does not stand in need of help
				from men. If one group of men shirked offering sacrifices
				in the cause of His Religion, Allah would remove it and
				bring another group in its place.

	<sura num="48">
		<section heading="Name">
			<p>
				It is derived from the words Inna fatah-na laka fat-han
				mubina of the very first verse. This is not only a name
				of the Surah but also its title in view of the subject
				matter, for it deals with the great victory that Allah
				granted to the Holy Prophet and the Muslims in the form
				of the Truce of Hudaibiyah.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				Traditions concur that it was sent down in Dhil-Qadah,
				A.H. 6, at a time when the Holy Prophet was on his return
				journey to Madinah after concluding the Truce of
				Hudaibiyah with the disbelievers of Makkah.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Historical Background">
			<p>
				The events in connection with which this Surah was sent
				down began life this: One day the Holy Prophet saw in a
				dream that he had gone to Makkah with his Companions and
				had performed the umrah there. Obviously, the Prophet's
				dream could not be a mere dream and fiction for it is a
				kind of Divine inspiration as Allah Himself has confirmed
				in verse 27 below and said that He Himself had shown that
				dream to His Messenger. Therefore, it was not merely a
				dream but a Divine inspiration which the Holy Prophet had
				to obey and follow.
			</p>
			<p>
				Apparently, there was no possible way of acting on this
				inspiration. The disbelieving Quraish had debarred the
				Muslims from proceeding to the Ka'bah for the past six
				years and no Muslim had been allowed during that period
				to approach the Kaabah for the purpose of performing hajj
				and umrah. Therefore, it could not be expected that they
				would allow the Holy Prophet to enter Makkah along with a
				party of his Companions. If they had proceeded to Makkah
				in the pilgrim garments with the intention of performing
				umrah, along with their arms, this would have provoked
				the enemy to war, and if they had proceeded unarmed, this
				would have meant endangering his own as well as his
				Companions' lives. Under conditions such as these nobody
				could see and suggest how the Divine inspiration could be
				acted upon.
			</p>
			<p>
				But the Prophet's position was different. It demanded
				that he should carry out whatever Command his Lord gave
				fearlessly and without any apprehension and doubt.
				Therefore, the Holy Prophet informed his Companions of
				his dream and began to make preparations for the journey.
				Among the tribes living in the suburbs also he had the
				public announcement made that he was proceeding for umrah
				and the people could join him. Those who could only see
				the apparent conditions thought that he and his
				Companions were going into the very jaws of death none of
				them therefore was inclined to accompany him in the
				expedition. But those who had true faith in Allah and His
				Messenger were least bothered about the consequences. For
				them this information was enough that it was a Divine
				inspiration and Allah's Prophet had made up his mind to
				carry it into effect. After this nothing could hinder
				them from accompanying the Messenger of Allah. Thus,
				1,400 of the Companions became ready to follow him on
				this highly dangerous journey.
			</p>
			<p>
				This blessed caravan set off from Madinah in the
				beginning of Dhil Qa'dah, A.H. 6. At Dhul Hulaifah they
				entered the pilgrims robe with the intention of umrah,
				took 70 camels with collars round their necks indicating
				that they were sacrificial animals; kept only a sword
				each in sheaths, which the pilgrims to the Kaabah were
				allowed to carry according to the recognized custom of
				Arabia, but no other weapon. Thus, the caravan set out
				for the Ka'bah, the House of Allah, at Makkah, chanting
				the prescribed slogan of Labbaik, Allahuma labbaik.
			</p>
			<p>
				The nature of the relations between Makkah and Madinah in
				those days was known too well to every Arab. Just the
				previous year, in Shawwal A.H. 5, the Quraish mustering
				the united strength of the Arab tribes had invaded
				Madinah and the well known Battle of the Trench had taken
				place. Therefore, when the Holy Prophet along with such a
				large caravan set off for the home of his blood-thirsty
				enemy, the whole of Arabia looked up with amazement, and
				the people also noticed that the caravan was not going
				with the intention to fight but was proceeding to the
				House of Allah in a forbidden month in the pilgrims garb
				carrying sacrificial animals and was absolutely unarmed.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Quraish were confounded at this bold step taken by
				the Holy Prophet. Dhil-Qa'dah was one of those forbidden
				months which had been held as sacred for pilgrimage in
				Arabia for centuries. Nobody had a right to interfere
				with a caravan which might be coming for hajj or umrah in
				the pilgrims garb in this month; so much so that even an
				enemy tribe could not hinder it from passing through its
				territory according to the recognized law of the land.
				The Quraish therefore were caught in a dilemma, for if
				they attacked this caravan from Madinah and stopped it
				from entering Makkah, this would arouse a clamor of
				protest in the whole country, and all the Arab tribes
				would have the misgiving that the Quraish had monopolized
				the Ka'bah as exclusively their own, and every tribe
				would be involved in the mistrust that now it depended on
				the will of the Quraish to allow or not to allow anyone
				to perform hajj or umrah in the future and that they
				would stop any tribe with which they were angry from
				visiting the Ka'bah just as they had stopped the Madinese
				pilgrims. This they thought would be a grave mistake,
				which would cause the entire Arabia to revolt against
				them. But, on the other hand, if they allowed Muhammad
				(upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings) and his large
				caravan to enter their city safely, they would lose their
				image of power in Arabia and the people would say that
				they were afraid of Muhammad. At last, after a great deal
				of confusion, perplexity and hesitation they were
				overcome by their false sense of honor and for the sake
				of their prestige they took the decision that they would
				at no cost allow the caravan to enter the city of Makkah.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Holy Prophet had despatched a man of the Bani Ka'b as
				a secret agent so that he may keep him fully informed of
				the intentions and movements of the Quraish. When the
				Holy Prophet reached Usfan, he brought the news that the
				Quraish had reached Dhi Tuwa with full preparations and
				they had sent Khalid bin Walid with two hundred cavalry
				men in advance towards Kura'al-Ghamim to intercept him.
				The Quraish wanted somehow to provoke the Holy Prophet's
				Companions into fighting so that they may tell the Arabs
				that those people had actually come to fight and had put
				on the pilgrims garments for umrah only to deceive
				others.
			</p>
			<p>
				Immediately on receipt of this information the Holy
				Prophet changed his route and following a very rugged,
				rocky track reached Hudaibiyah, which was situated right
				on the boundary of the sacred Makkan territory. Here, he
				was visited by Budail bin Warqa the chief of the Bani
				Khuza'ah, along with some men of his tribe. They asked
				what he had come for. The Holy Prophet replied that he
				and his Companions bad come only for pilgrimage to the
				House of Allah and for going round it in worship and not
				for war. The men of Khuza'ah went and told this to the
				Quraish chiefs and counseled them not to interfere with
				the pilgrims. But the Quraish were obstinate. They sent
				Hulays bin Alqamah, the chief of the Ahabish, to the Holy
				Prophet to persuade him to go back. Their object was that
				when Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) would not
				listen to Hulays, he would come back disappointed and
				then the entire power of the Ahabish would be on their
				side. But when Hulays went and saw that the whole caravan
				had put on the pilgrims garments, had brought sacrificial
				camels with festive collars round their necks, and had
				come for doing reverence to the House of Allah and not to
				fight, he returned to Makkah without having any dialogue
				with the Holy Prophet and told the Quraish chiefs plainly
				that those people had no other object but to pay a visit
				to the Ka'bah; if they debarred them from it, the Ahabish
				would not join them in that, because they had not become
				their allies to support them even if they violated the
				sacred customs and traditions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then the Quraish sent Urwah bin Mas'ud Thaqafi; he had
				lengthy negotiations with the Holy Prophet in an effort
				to persuade him to give up his intention to enter Makkah.
				But the Holy Prophet gave him also the same reply that he
				had given to the chief of the Khuza'ah, that they had not
				come to fight but to do honor to the House of Allah and
				carry out a religious duty. Urwah went back and said to
				the Quraish: "I have been to the courts of the Caesar and
				Khosroes, and the Negus also, but by God, never have I
				seen any people so devoted to a king as are the
				Companions of Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and
				blessings) to him. If Muhammad makes his ablutions they
				would not let the water thereof fall on the ground but
				would rub it on their bodies and clothes. Now you may
				decide as to what you should do."
			</p>
			<p>
				In the meantime when the messages were coming and the
				negotiations were going on, the Quraish tried again and
				again to quietly launch sudden attacks on the Muslim camp
				in order to provoke the Companions and somehow incite
				them to war, but every time they did so the Companions'
				forbearance and patience and the Holy Prophet's wisdom
				and sagacity frustrated their designs. On one occasion
				forty or fifty of their men came at night and attacked
				the Muslim camp with stones and arrows. The Companions
				arrested all of them and took them before the Holy
				Prophet, but he let them go. On another occasion 80 men
				came from the direction of Tan'im right at the time of
				the Fajr Prayer and made a sudden attack. They were also
				caught, but the Holy Prophet forgave them, too. Thus, the
				Quraish went on meeting failure after failure in every
				one of their designs.
			</p>
			<p>
				At last, the Holy Prophet sent Hadrat Uthman (may Allah
				be pleased with him) as his own messenger to Makkah with
				the message that they had not come to fight but only for
				pilgrimage and had brought their sacrificial camels
				along, and they would go back after performing the rite
				of pilgrimage and offering the sacrifice. But the Quraish
				did not agree and withheld Hadrat Uthman in the city. In
				the meantime a rumor spread that Hadrat Uthman had been
				killed; and when he did not return in time the Muslims
				took the rumor to be true. Now they could show no more
				forbearance. Entry into Makkah was different for there
				was no intention to use force. But when the ambassador
				was put to death, the Muslims had no alternative but to
				prepare for war. Therefore, the Holy Prophet summoned all
				his Companions together and took a solemn pledge from
				them that they would fight to death. In view of the
				critical occasion it was not an ordinary undertaking. The
				Muslims numbered only 1400 and had come without any
				weapons, were encamping at the boundary of Makkah, 250
				miles away from their own city, and the enemy could
				attack them in full strength, and could surround them
				with its allies from the adjoining tribes as well. In
				spite of this, none from the caravan except one man
				failed to give his pledge to fight to death, and there
				could be no greater proof of their dedication and
				sincerity than that in the cause of Allah. This pledge is
				well known in the history of Islam as the pledge of
				Ridwan.
			</p>
			<p>
				Later it was known that the news about Hadrat Uthman was
				false. Not only did he return but under Suhail bin 'Amr
				from the Quraish also arrived a deputation to negotiate
				peace with the Holy Prophet. Now, the Quraish no more
				insisted that they would disallow the Holy Prophet and
				his Companions to enter Makkah. However, in order to save
				their face they only insisted that he went back that year
				but could come the following year to perform the umrah.
				After lengthy negotiations peace was concluded on the
				following terms:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					War would remain suspended for ten years, and no
					party would indulge in any hostility, open or
					secret, against the other.
				</li>
				<li>
					If any one during that period from among the
					Quraish went over to Muhammad, without his
					guardian's permission, he would return him to
					them, but if a Companion of Muhammad came oven to
					the Quraish, they would not return him to him.
				</li>
				<li>
					Every Arab tribe would have the option to join
					either side as its ally and enter the treaty.
				</li>
				<li>
					Muhammad and his men would go back that year and
					could come the following year for umrah and stay
					in Makkah for three days, provided that they
					brought only one sheathed sword each, and no
					other weapon of war. In those three days the
					Makkans would vacate the city for them (so that
					there was no chance of a clash), but they would
					not be allowed to take along any Makkan on
					return. When the conditions of the treaty were
					being settled, the whole of the Muslim army was
					feeling greatly upset. No one understood the
					expedience because of which the Holy Prophet was
					accepting the conditions. No one was farsighted
					enough to foresee the great benefit that was to
					result from this treaty. The disbelieving Quraish
					looked at it as their victory, and the Muslims
					were upset as to why they should be humiliated to
					accepting those mean conditions. Even a statesman
					of the caliber of Hadrat Umar says that he had
					never given way to doubt since the time he had
					embraced Islam but on this occasion he also could
					not avoid it. Impatient he went to Hadrat Abu
					Bakr and said "Is he (the Holy Prophet) not
					Allah's Messenger, and are we not Muslims, and
					are they not polytheists? Then, why should we
					agree to what is humiliating to our Faith?" He
					replied "O Umar, he is surely Allah's Messenger,
					and Allah will never make him the loser."
					Unsatisfied he went to the Holy Prophet himself
					and put the same questions to him, and he also
					gave him the same replies as Hadrat Abu Bakr had
					given. Afterwards Hadrat Umar continued to offer
					voluntary prayers and give aims so that Allah may
					pardon his insolence that he had shown towards
					the Holy Prophet on that occasion.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Two things in the treaty were highly disturbing for the
				Muslims first, the second condition, about which they
				said that it was an expressly unfair condition, for if
				they had to return a fugitive from Makkah, why should not
				the Quraish return a fugitive from Madinah? To this the
				Holy Prophet replied: "What use would be he to us, who
				fled from us to them? May Allah keep him away from us!
				And if we return the one who flees to us from them, Allah
				will create some other way out for him." The other thing
				that was rankling in their minds was the fourth
				condition. The Muslims thought that agreeing to it meant
				that they were going back unsuccessful and this was
				humiliating. Furthermore, the question that was causing
				them feel upset was that they had accepted the condition
				of going back without performing the pilgrimage to the
				Ka'bah, whereas the Holy Prophet had seen in the vision
				that they were performing tawaf at Makkah. To this the
				Holy Prophet replied that in his vision the year had not
				been specified. According to the treaty conditions,
				therefore, they would perform the tawaf the following
				year if it pleased Allah.
			</p>
			<p>
				Right at the time when the document was being written,
				Suhail bin 'Amr's own son, Abu Jandal, who had become a
				Muslim and been imprisoned by the pagans of Makkah
				somehow escaped to the Holy Prophet's camp. He had
				fetters on his feet and signs of violence on his body. He
				implored the Holy Prophet that he help secure his release
				from imprisonment. The scene only increased the
				Companions' dejection, and they were moved beyond
				control. But Suhail bin 'Amr said the conditions of the
				agreement had been concluded between them although the
				writing was not yet complete; therefore, the boy should
				be returned to them. The Holy Prophet admitted his
				argument and Abu Jandal was returned to his oppressors.
			</p>
			<p>
				When the document was finished, the Holy Prophet spoke to
				the Companions and told them to slaughter their
				sacrificial animals at that very place, shave their heads
				and put off the pilgrim garments, but no one moved from
				his place. The Holy Prophet repeated the order thrice but
				the Companions were so overcome by depression and
				dejection that they did not comply. During his entire
				period of apostleship on no occasion had it ever happened
				that he should command his Companions to do a thing and
				they should not hasten to comply with it. This caused him
				a great shock, and he repaired to his tent and expressed
				his grief before his wife, Hadrat Umm Salamah. She said,
				"You may quietly go and slaughter your own camel and call
				the barber and have your head shaved. After that the
				people would automatically do what you did and would
				understand that whatever decision had been taken would
				not be changed." Precisely the same thing happened. The
				people slaughtered their animals, shaved their heads or
				cut their hair short and put off the pilgrim garb, but
				their hearts were still afflicted with grief.
			</p>
			<p>
				Later, when this caravan was returning to Madinah,
				feeling depressed and dejected at the truce of
				Hudaibiyab, this Surah came down at Dajnan (or according
				to some others, at Kura' al-Ghamim), which told the
				Muslims that the treaty that they were regarding as their
				defeat, was indeed a great victory. After it had come
				down, the Holy Prophet summoned the Muslims together and
				said: "Today such a thing has been sent down to me, which
				is more valuable to me than the world and what it
				contains." Then be recited this Surah, especially to
				Hadrat Umar, for he was the one who was feeling most
				dejected.
			</p>
			<p>
				Although the believers were satisfied when they heard
				this Divine Revelation, not much longer afterwards the
				advantages of this treaty began to appear one after the
				other until every one became fully convinced that this
				peace treaty indeed was a great victory:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					In it for the first time the existence of the
					Islamic State in Arabia was duly recognized.
					Before this in the eyes of the Arabs the position
					of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be
					Allah's peace) and his Companions was no more
					than of mere rebels against the Quraish and other
					Arab tribes, and they regarded them as the
					outlaws. Now the Quraish themselves by concluding
					this agreement with the Holy Prophet recognized
					his sovereignty over the territories of the
					Islamic State and opened the way for the Arab
					tribes to enter treaties of alliance with either
					of the political powers they liked.
				</li>
				<li>
					By admitting the right of pilgrimage to the House
					of Allah for the Muslims, the Quraish also
					admitted that Islam was not an anti-religious
					creed, as they had so far been thinking, but it
					was one of the admitted religions of Arabia, and
					like the other Arabs, its followers also had the
					right to perform the rites of hajj and umrah.
					This diminished the hatred in the Arabs hearts
					that had been caused by the propaganda made by
					the Quraish against Islam.
				</li>
				<li>
					The signing of a no-war pact for ten years
					provided full peace to the Muslims, and spreading
					to every nook and corner of Arabia they preached
					Islam with such spirit and speed that within two
					years after Hudaibiyah the number of the people
					who embraced Islam far exceeded those who bad
					embraced it during the past 19 years or so. It
					was all due to this treaty that two years later
					when in consequence of the Quraish's violating
					the treaty the Holy Prophet invaded Makkah, he
					was accompanied by an army 10,000 strong, whereas
					on the occasion of Hudaibiyah only 1,400 men had
					joined him in the march.
				</li>
				<li>
					After the suspension of hostilities by the
					Quraish the Holy Prophet had the opportunity to
					establish and strengthen Islamic rule in the
					territories under him and to turn the Islamic
					society into a full fledged civilization and way
					of life by the enforcement of Islamic law. This
					is that great blessing about which Allah says in
					verse 3 of Surah Al-Ma'idah: "Today I have
					perfected your Religion for you and completed My
					blessing on you and approved Islam as the Way of
					Life for you." (for explanation, see Introduction
					to Surah Al-Ma'idah and its E. N. 15).
				</li>
				<li>
					Another gain that accrued from the truce with the
					Quraish was that being assured of peace from the
					south the Muslims overpowered all the opponent
					forces in the north and central Arabia easily.
					Just three months after Hudaibiyah, Khaiber, the
					major stronghold of the Jews, was conquered and
					after it the Jewish settlements of Fadak, Wad-il
					Qura, Taima and Tabuk also fell to Islam one
					after the other. Then all other tribes of central
					Arabia, which were bound in alliance with the
					Jews and Quraish, came under the sway of Islam.
					Thus, within two years after Hudaibiyah the
					balance of power in Arabia was so changed that
					the strength of the Quraish and pagan gave way
					and the domination of Islam became certain.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				These were the blessings that the Muslims gained from the
				peace treaty which they were looking upon as their defeat
				and the Quraish as their victory. However, what had
				troubled the Muslims most in this treaty, was the
				condition about the fugitives from Makkah and Madinah,
				that the former would be returned and the latter would
				not be returned. But not much long after- wards this
				condition also proved to be disadvantageous for the
				Quraish, and experience revealed what far reaching
				consequences of it had the Holy Prophet foreseen and then
				accepted it. A few days after the treaty a Muslim of
				Makkah, Abu Basir, escaped from the Quraish and reached
				Madinah. The Quraish demanded him back and the Holy
				Prophet returned him to their men who had been sent from
				Makkah to arrest him. But while on the way to Makkah he
				again fled and went and sat on the road by the Red Sea
				shore, which the trade caravans of the Quraish took to
				Syria. After that every Muslim who succeeded in escaping
				from the Quraish would go and join Abu Basir instead of
				going to Madinah, until 70 men gathered there. They would
				attack any Quraish caravan that passed the way and cut it
				into pieces at last, the Quraish themselves begged the
				Holy Prophet to call those men to Madinah, and the
				condition relating to the return of the fugitives of
				itself became null and void. The Surah should be read
				with this historical background in view in order to fully
				understand it.

				Traditions show and the subject matter of the Surah also
				supports the same that this Surah is a collection of the
				commandments and instructions sent down on different
				occasions, which have been put together because of the
				relevancy of the theme. Moreover, the traditions also
				show that most of these commandments were sent down
				during the final stage of the Holy Prophet's life at
				Madinah. For instance, about verse 4 the commentators
				state that it was sent down concerning the Bani Tamim
				whose deputation had arrived in Madinah and started
				calling out to the Holy Prophet from outside the
				apartments (hujurat) of his wives, and according to all
				biographical books on the Holy Prophet's life this
				deputation had visited Madinah in A.H. 9. Likewise, about
				verse 6 a large number of the traditions of Hadith
				confirm that it was sent down concerning Walid bin Uqbah
				whom the Holy Prophet had sent to collect the zakat from
				the Bani al-Mustaliq, and it is well known that Walid bin

				The subject matter of this Surah is to teach the Muslims
				the manners worthy of true believers. In the first five
				verses they have been taught the manners they should
				observe with regard to Allah and His Messenger.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, they have been given the instruction that it is not
				right to believe in every news blindly and to act
				according to it, without due thought. If information is
				received about a person, a group or a community, it
				should be seen carefully whether the means of the
				information is reliable or not. If the means is not
				reliable, it should be tested and examined to see whether
				the news is authentic or not before taking any action on
				it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, it has been told what attitude should the other
				Muslims adopt in case two groups of the Muslims fall to
				mutual fighting. Then the Muslims have been exhorted to
				safeguard against the evils that corrupt collective life
				and spoil mutual relationships. Mocking and taunting each
				other, calling others by nicknames, creating suspicions,
				prying into other people's affairs and backbiting are the
				evils which are not only sins in themselves but they also
				corrupt society. Allah has mentioned all these evils
				separately and forbidden them as unlawful.
			</p>
			<p>
				After this, the national and racial distinctions that
				cause universal corruption in the world have been
				condemned. Nations' and tribes' and families' pride of
				ancestry and their looking down upon others as inferior
				to themselves and their pulling down others only for the
				sake of establishing their own superiority is an
				important factor that has filled the world with
				injustices and tyranny. Allah in a brief verse has cut at
				the root of this evil by stating that all men are
				descendants of the same one pair and their division into
				tribes and communities is only for the sake of
				recognition, not for boasting and pride, and there is no
				lawful basis of one man's superiority over the other
				except on the basis of moral excellence.
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, the people have been told that the real
				thing is not the verbal Profession of the Faith but to
				believe in Allah and His messenger truly, to obey them in
				practical life and to exert sincerely with one's self and
				wealth in the cause of Allah. True believers are only
				those who adopt this attitude. As for those who profess
				Islam merely orally without affirmation by the heart and
				then adopt an attitude as if they had done someone a
				favor by accepting Islam, may be counted among the
				Muslims in the world, may even be treated as Muslims in
				society, but they cannot be counted as believers in the
				sight of Allah.

				The Surah derives its name from the initial letter Qaf,

				There is no authentic tradition to show as to when
				exactly this Surah was sent down. A study of the subject
				matter, however, reveals that its period of revelation is
				the second stage of the Holy Prophet's life at Makkah,
				which lasted from the third year of the Prophethood till
				the fifth year. We have given the characteristics of this
				period in the Introduction to the Surah Al-An'am. In view
				of those characteristics it can be said that this Surah
				might have been sent down in about the 5th year, when the
				antagonism of the disbelievers had become quite intense
				but had not yet assumed tyrannical proportions.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Topics">
			<p>
				Authentic traditions show that the Holy Prophet used to
				recite this Surah generally in the Prayer on the Eid
				days. A woman named Umm Hisham bin Harithah, who was a
				neighbor of the Holy Prophet, says that she was able to
				commit Surah Qaf to memory only because she often heard
				it from the Holy Prophet in the Friday sermons. According
				to some other traditions he often recited it in the Fajr
				Prayer. This makes it abundantly clear that this was an
				important Surah in the sight of the Holy Prophet. That is
				why he made sure that its contents reached as many people
				as possible over and over again.
			</p>
			<p>
				This reason for this importance can be easily understood
				by a careful study of the Surah. The theme of the entire
				Surah is the Hereafter. When the Holy Prophet started
				preaching his message in Makkah what surprised the people
				most was the news that people would be resurrected after
				death, and they would have to render an account of their
				deeds. They said that that was impossible; human mind
				could not believe that that would happen. After all, how
				could it be possible that when the body had disintegrated
				into dust the scattered particles would be reassembled
				after hundreds of thousands of years to make up the same
				body once again and raised up as a living body, Allah in
				response sent down this discourse. In it, on the one
				hand, arguments have been given for the possibility and
				occurrence of the Hereafter in a brief way, in short
				sentences, and, on the other, the people have been
				warned, as if to say: "Whether you express wonder and
				surprise, or you regard it as something remote from
				reason, or deny it altogether, in any case it cannot
				change the truth. The absolute, unalterable truth is that
				Allah knows the whereabouts of each and every particle of
				your body that has scattered away in the earth, and knows
				where and in what state it is. Allah's one signal is
				enough to make all the scattered particles gather
				together again and to make you rise up once again as you
				had been made in the first instance. Likewise, this idea
				that you have been created and left free to yourselves in
				the world and that you have not been made answerable to
				anyone, is no more than a misunderstanding. The fact is
				that not only is Allah Himself directly aware of each act
				and word of yours, even of the ideas that pass in your
				mind, but His angels also are attached to each one of
				you, who are preserving the record of whatever you do and
				utter. When the time comes, you will come out of your
				graves at one call just as young shoots of vegetable
				sprout up from the earth on the first shower of the rain.
				Then this heedlessness which obstructs your vision will
				be removed and you will see with your own eyes all that
				you are denying today. At that time you will realize that
				you had not been created to be irresponsible in this
				world but accountable to all your deeds. The meting out
				of the rewards and punishments, the Hell and Heaven,
				which you regard as impossible and imaginary things, will
				at that time become visible realities for you. In
				consequence of your enmity and opposition to the Truth
				you will be cast into the same Hell which you regard as
				remote from reason today and the ones who fear the
				Merciful God and return to the path of righteousness,
				will be admitted to the same Paradise at whose mention
				you now express wonder and surprise.

				It is derived from the very first word wadh-dhariyat,
			</p>

				which implies that it is a Surah which begins with the

		<section heading="Period of Revelation">

				The subject matter and the style clearly show that it was
				sent down in the period when although the Holy Prophet's
				invitation was being resisted and opposed with denial and
				ridicule and false accusations stubbornly, persecution
				had not yet started. Therefore, this Surah also seems to
				have been revealed in the same period in which the Surah
				Qaf was revealed.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Subject Matter and Topics">
			<p>
				The Surah mostly deals with the Hereafter, and in the end
				it presents the invitation to Tauhid. In addition, the
				people have also been warned that refusal to accept the
				message of the Prophets and persistence in the concepts
				and creeds of ignorance have proved to be disastrous for
				those nations themselves which have adopted this attitude
				and way of life in the past.
			</p>
			<p>
				About the Hereafter what this Surah presents in short but
				pithy sentences is this: The people's different and
				conflicting beliefs about the end of human life are
				themselves an express proof that none of these beliefs
				and creeds is based on knowledge; everyone by himself has
				formed an ideology on the basis of conjecture and made
				the same his creed. Someone thought that there would be
				no life-after-death; someone believed in the
				life-after-death, but in the form of the transmigration
				of souls; someone believed in the life hereafter and the
				meting out of the rewards and punishments but invented
				different sorts of props and supports to escape
				retribution. About a question of such vital and
				fundamental importance a wrong view of which renders
				man's whole life-work wrong and waste and ruins his
				future for ever, it would be a disastrous folly to build
				an ideology only on the basis of speculation and
				conjecture, without knowledge. It would mean that man
				should remain involved in a grave misunderstanding, pass
				his whole life in the heedlessness of error, and after
				death should suddenly meet with a situation for which he
				had made no preparation at all. There is only one way of
				forming the right opinion about such a question, and it
				is this: Man should seriously ponder over the knowledge
				about the Hereafter that the Prophet of Allah is
				conveying to him from Him, and should study carefully the
				system of the earth and heavens and his own existence:
				and should see whether the evidence of that knowledge's
				being sound and correct is afforded by everything around
				him or not. In this regard, the arrangement of the wind
				and rain, the structure of the earth and the creatures
				found on it, man's own self, the creation of the heavens
				and of everything in the world in the form of pairs have
				been presented as evidence of the Hereafter, and
				instances have been cited from human history to show that
				the temper of the empire of the Universe requires that
				the law of retribution must operate here.
			</p>
			<p>
				After this, giving the invitation to Tauhid briefly, it
				has been said: "Your Creator has not created you for the
				service of others but for His own service. He is not like
				your false gods, which receive sustenance from you and
				godhead of which cannot function without your help, but
				He is a God Who is the Sustainer of all, Who does not
				stand in need of sustenance from anyone and Whose Godhead
				is functioning by His own power and might.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this very connection, it has also been stated that
				whenever the Prophets of Allah have been opposed and
				resisted, they have not been opposed and resisted on the
				basis of any rational ground but on the basis of the same
				obduracy and stubbornness and false pride that is being
				shown against the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings
				of Allah be upon him), and there is no other motive for
				it than rebellion and arrogance. Then the Holy Prophet
				has been instructed not to bother about the rebels but to
				go on performing his mission of invitation and
				admonition, for it is useful and beneficial for the
				believers although it may not be so for the other people.
				As for the wicked people who still persist in their
				rebellion, they should know that their predecessors who
				followed the same way of life, have already received
				their shares of the punishment, and these people's share
				of the punishment has been made ready for them.

				From the internal evidence of the subject matter it
				appears that this Surah too was revealed in the same

				Surah Adh-Dhariyat was revealed. While going through it
				one can clearly feel that during the period of its

				severe persecution of the Muslims had started.

				The subject matter of its first section (vv. 1-28) is the
				Hereafter. As arguments for its possibility, necessity
				and occurrence had already been given in Surah
				Adh-Dhariyat, these have not been repeated here. However,
				swearing an oath by some realities and signs which
				testify to the Hereafter, it has been stated most
				emphatically that it will surely come to pass, and none
				has the power to prevent its occurrence. Then, it has
				been stated as to what will be the fate of those who deny
				it when it actually occurs, and how will those who
				believe in it and adopt the way of piety and
				righteousness accordingly, be blessed by Allah.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, in the second section (vv. 29-49) the Quraish
				chiefs' attitude towards the message of the Holy Prophet
				(peace and blessings of Allah he upon him) has been
				criticized. They called him a sorcerer, a madman, or a
				poet, and would thus mislead the common people against
				him so that they should not pay any serious attention to
				the message he preached. They looked upon him as a
				calamity that had suddenly descended on them and would
				openly wish that he met with a disaster so that they were
				rid of him. They accused him of fabricating the Quran by
				himself and of presenting it in the name of Allah, and
				this was, God forbid, a fraud that he was practicing.
				They would often taunt him, saying that God could not
				have appointed an ordinary man like him to the office of
				Prophethood. They expressed great disgust at his
				invitation and message and would avoid him as if he was
				asking them for a reward for it. They would sit and take
				counsels together to devise schemes in order to put an
				end to his mission. And while they did all this they
				never realized what creeds of ignorance they were
				involved in and how selflessly and sincerely was Muhammad
				(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) exerting
				himself to deliver them from their error. While
				criticizing them for this attitude and conduct, Allah has
				put them certain questions, one after the other, each of
				which is either an answer to some objection of theirs, or
				a criticism of some error. Then, it has been said that it
				would absolutely be of no avail to show them a miracle in
				order to convince them of his Prophethood, for they were
				such stubborn people as would misinterpret anything they
				were shown only to avoid affirming the faith.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the beginning of this section as well as in its end,
				the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon
				him) has been given the instruction that he should
				persistently continue giving his invitation and preaching
				his message in spite of the accusations and objections of
				his opponents and enemies, and should endure their
				resistance patiently till Allah's judgment comes to pass.
				Besides, he has been consoled, as if to say "Your Lord
				has not left you alone to face your enemies, after
				raising you as a Prophet, but He is constantly watching
				over you. Therefore, endure every hardship patiently till
				the Hour of His judgment comes, and seek through praising
				and glorifying your Lord the power that is required for
				exerting in the cause of Allah under such conditions.

				The Surah derives its name from the very first word wan
				Najm. This title also does not relate to the subject
				matter, but is a name given to the Surah as a symbol.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				According to a Tradition related by Bukhari, Muslim, Abu
				Da'ud and Nasai, on the authority of Hadrat Abdullah bin
				Mas'ud, the first Surah in which a verse requiring the
				performance of a sajdah (prostration) was sent down, is
				Surah An-Najm. The parts of this Hadith which have been
				reported by Aswad bin Yazid, Abu Ishaq and Zubair bin
				Mu'awiyah from Hadrat Ibn Mas'ud, indicate that this is
				the first Surah of the Quran, which the Holy Prophet
				(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had publicly
				recited before an assembly of the Quraish (and according
				to Ibn Marduyah, in the Ka'bah) in which both the
				believers and the disbelievers were present. At the end,
				when he recited the verse requiring the performance of a
				sajdah and fell down in prostration, the whole assembly
				also fall down in prostration with him, and even those
				chiefs of the polytheists who were in the forefront of
				the opposition to the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings
				of Allah be upon him) could not resist falling down in
				prostration. Ibn Mas'ud (may Allah be pleased with him)
				says that he saw only one man, Umayyah bin Khalaf, from
				among the disbelievers, who did not fall down in
				prostration but took a little dust and rubbing it on his
				forehead said that that was enough for him. Later, as Ibn
				Mas'ud relates, he saw this man being killed in the state
				of disbelief.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another eye witness of this incident is Hadrat Muttalib
				bin Abi Wada'ah, who had not yet become a Muslim. Nasai
				and Musnad Ahmad contain his own words to the effect:
				"When the Holy Prophet recited the Surah An-Najm and
				performed the sajdah and the whole assembly fell down in
				prostration along with him, I did not perform the sajdah.
				Now to compensate for the same whenever I recite this
				Surah I make sure never to abandon its performance."
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Sad says that before this, in the Rajab of the 5th
				year of Prophethood, a small group of the Companions had
				emigrated to Abyssinia. Then, when in the Ramadan of the
				same year this incident took place the news spread that
				the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon
				him) had recited Surah An-Najm publicly in the assembly
				of the Quraish and the whole assembly, including the
				believers as well as the disbelievers, had fallen down in
				prostration with him. When the emigrants to Abyssinia
				heard this news they formed the impression that the
				disbelievers of Makkah had become Muslims. Thereupon,
				some of them returned to Makkah in the Shawwal of the 5th
				year of Prophethood, only to learn that the news was
				wrong and the conflict between Islam and disbelief was
				raging as furiously as before. Concequently, the second
				emigration to Abyssinia took place, in which many more
				people left Makkah. Thus, it becomes almost certain that
				this Surah was revealed in the Ramadan of 5th year of
				Prophethood.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Historical Background">
			<p>
				The details of the period of revelation as given above
				point to the conditions in which this Surah was revealed.
				During the first five years of his appointment as a
				Prophet, the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah
				be upon him) had been extending invitation to Allah's
				Religion by presenting the Divine Revelations before the
				people only in private and restricted meetings and
				assemblies. During this whole period he could never have
				a chance to recite the Quran before a common gathering
				openly, mainly because of the strong opposition and
				resistance from the disbelievers. They were well aware of
				how magnetic and captivating was the Holy Prophet's
				personality and his way of preaching and how impressive
				were the Revelations of the Quran. Therefore, they tried
				their best to avoid hearing it themselves and to stop
				others also from hearing it and to suppress his
				invitation by false propaganda by spreading every kind of
				suspicion against him. For this object, on the one hand,
				they were telling the people that Muhammad (peace and
				blessings of Allah be upon him) had gone astray and was
				now bent upon misleading others as well; on the other
				hand, they would raise an uproar whenever he tried to
				present the Quran before the people so that no one could
				know what it was for which he was being branded as a
				misled and misguided person.
			</p>
			<p>
				Such were the conditions when the Holy Prophet (peace and
				blessings of Allah be upon him) suddenly stood up one day
				to make a speech in the sacred precincts of the Ka'bah,
				where a large number of the Quraish had gathered
				together. Allah at that time made him deliver this
				discourse, which we have now in the form of the Surah
				An-Najm with us. Such was the intensity of the impression
				that when the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah
				be upon him) started reciting it the opponents were so
				completely overwhelmed that they could not think of
				raising any disorder, and when at the conclusion he fell
				down in prostration, they too fell down in prostration
				along with him. Later they felt great remorse at the
				weakness they had involuntarily shown. The people also
				started taunting them to the effect that whereas they had
				been forbidding others to listen to the Quran, that day
				not only had they themselves listened to it, with
				complete absorption but had even fallen down in
				prostration along with Muhammad (peace and blessings of
				Allah be upon him). At last, they had to invent a story
				in order to get rid of the people's taunt and ridicule.
				They said, "After he had recited afara'ait-ul Lata wal
				Uzza wa Manat ath-thalitha-al ukhra, we heard from
				Muhammad the words: tilk al-gharaniqa- tal-'ula, wa anna
				shafa'at-u-hunna latarja: 'They are exalted goddesses:
				indeed, their intercession may be expected.' From this we
				understood that Muhammad had returned to our faith." As a
				matter of fact, only a mad person could think that in the
				context of this Surah the sentences they claimed to have
				heard could have any place and relevance.(For details,
				please see E. N.'s 96 to 301 of Surah Al Hajj).
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Subject Matter and Topics">
			<p>
				The theme of the discourse is to warn the disbelievers of
				Makkah about the error of the attitude that they had
				adopted towards the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad (peace
				and blessings of Allah be upon him).
			</p>
			<p>
				The discourse starts in a way as if to say: "Muhammad is
				neither deluded nor gone astray, as you are telling
				others in your propaganda against him, nor has he
				fabricated this teaching of Islam and its message, as you
				seem to think he has. In fact, whatever he is presenting
				is nothing but Revelation which is sent down to him. The
				verities that he presents before you, are not the product
				of his own surmise and speculation but realities of which
				he himself is an eye witness. He has himself seen the
				Angel through whom this knowledge is conveyed to him. He
				has been directly made to observe the great Signs of his
				Lord: whatever he says is not what he has himself thought
				out but what he has seen with his own eyes. Therefore,
				your disputing and wrangling with him is just like the
				disputing and wrangling of a blind man with a man of
				sight over a thing which the blind man cannot see but he
				can see."
			</p>
			<p>
				After this, three things have been presented in their
				successive order: First, the listeners have been made to
				understand that: "The religion that you are following is
				based on mere conjecture and invented ideas. You have set
				up a few goddesses like Lat and Manat and Uzza as your
				deities, whereas they have no share whatever in divinity.
				You regard the angels as the daughters of Allah, whereas
				you regard a daughter as disgraceful for your own selves.
				You think that these deities of yours can influence Allah
				in your favor, whereas the fact is that all the angels
				together, who are stationed closest to Allah, cannot
				influence Him even in their own favor. None of such
				beliefs that you have adopted, is based on knowledge and
				reason, but are wishes and desires for the sake of which
				you have taken some whims as realities. This is a grave
				error. The right and true religion is that which is in
				conformity to the reality, and the reality is never
				subject to the people's wishes and desires so that
				whatever they may regard as a reality and truth should
				become the reality and truth. Speculation and conjecture
				cannot help to determine as to what is according to the
				truth and what is not; it is knowledge. When that
				knowledge is presented before you, you turn away from it,
				and brand the one who tells you the truth as misguided.
				The actual cause of your being involved in this error is
				that you are heedless of the Hereafter. Only this world
				is your goal. Therefore, you have neither any desire for
				the knowledge of reality, nor do you bother to see
				whether the beliefs you hold are according to the truth
				or not.
			</p>
			<p>
				Secondly, the people have been told that: Allah is the
				Master and Sovereign of the entire Universe. The
				righteous is he who follows His way, and the misguided he
				who has turned away from His way. The error of the
				misguided and the righteousness of the righteous are not
				hidden from Him. He knows whatever everyone is doing: He
				will requite the evil with evil and the good with good.
				The final judgment will not depend on what you consider
				yourself to be, and on tall claims you make of your
				purity and chastity but on whether you are pious or
				impious, righteous or unrighteous, in the sight of God.
				If you refrain from major sins, He in His mercy will
				overlook your minor errors.''
			</p>
			<p>
				Thirdly, a few basic principles of the true Religion
				which had been presented hundreds of years before the
				revelation of the Quran in the Books of the Prophets
				Abraham and Moses have been reiterated so that the people
				did not remain involved in the misunderstanding that the
				Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon
				him) had brought some new and novel religion, but they
				should know that these are the fundamental truths which
				the former Prophets of Allah have always been presenting
				in their respective ages. Besides, the same Books have
				been quoted to confirm the historical facts that the
				destruction of the 'Ad and the Thamud and of the people
				of the Prophets Noah and Lot was not the result of
				accidental calamities, but Allah has destroyed them in
				consequence of the same wickedness and rebellion from
				which the disbelievers of Makkah were not inclined to
				refrain and desist in any case.
			</p>
			<p>
				After presenting these themes and discourses the Surah
				has been concluded, thus: "The Hour of Judgment has
				approached near at hand, which no one can avert. Before
				the occurrence of that Hour you are being warned through
				Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and
				the Quran in the like manner as the former people had
				been warned before. Now, is it this warning that you find
				novel and strange? Which you mock and ridicule? Which you
				turn away from and cause disorder so that no one else
				also is able to hear what it is? Don't you feel like
				weeping at your folly and ignorance? Abandon this
				attitude and behaviour, bow down to Allah and serve Him
				alone!"
			</p>
			<p>
				This was that impressive conclusion hearing which even
				the most hardened deniers of the Truth were completely
				overwhelmed, and when after reciting these verses of
				Divine Word the Holy Messenger of Allah (peace and
				blessings of Allah be upon him) fell down in prostration,
				they too could not help falling down in prostration along
				with him.

				The Surah takes its name from the very first verse Wan
				shaqq al-Qamar, thereby implying that it is a Surah in
				which the word al-Qamar has occurred.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				The incident of the shaqq-al-Qamar (splitting of the
				moon) that has been mentioned in it, determines its
				period of revelation precisely. The traditionists and
				commentators are agreed that this incident took place at
				Mina in Makkah about five years before the Holy Prophet's
				hijra to Madinah.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				In this Surah the disbelievers of Makkah have been warned
				for their stubbornness which they had adopted against the
				invitation of the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of
				Allah be upon him). The amazing and wonderful phenomenon
				of the splitting of the Moon was a manifest sign of the
				truth that the Resurrection, of which the Holy Prophet
				was giving them the news, could take place and that it
				had approached near at hand. The great sphere of the Moon
				had split into two distinct parts in front of their very
				eyes. The two parts had separated and receded so much
				apart from each other that to the on-lookers one part had
				appeared on one side of the mountain and the other on the
				other side of it. Then, in an instant the two had
				rejoined. This was a manifest proof of the truth that the
				system of the Universe was neither eternal nor immortal,
				it could be disrupted. Huge stars and planets could split
				asunder, disintegrate, collide with each other, and
				everything that had been depicted in the Quran in
				connection with the description of the details of
				Resurrection, could happen. Not only this: it was also a
				portent that the disintegration of the system of the
				Universe had begun and the time was near when
				Resurrection would take place. The Holy Prophet (peace
				and blessings of Allah be upon him) invited the people's
				attention to this event only with this object in view and
				asked them to mark it and be a witness to it. But the
				disbelievers described it as a magical illusion add
				persisted in their denial. For this stubbornness they
				have been reproached in this Surah.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the outset it has been said: "These people neither
				believe in the admonition, nor learn a lesson from
				history, nor affirm faith after witnessing manifest signs
				with their eyes. Now they would believe only when
				Resurrection has taken place and they would be rushing
				out of their graves towards the Summoner on that Day."
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, the stories of the people of Noah and of 'Ad and
				Thamud and of the peoples of Lot and the Pharaoh have
				been related briefly and they have been reminded of the
				terrible punishments that these nations suffered when
				they belied and disregarded the warnings given by the
				Prophets of God. After the narration of each story the
				refrain that has been provided is: "This Quran is an easy
				means of admonition, which if a nation takes to heart and
				thereby takes the Right Way, the torment that descended
				on the former nations could be avoided. But it would
				indeed be a folly if instead of heeding the admonition
				through this easy means, one persisted in heedlessness
				and disbelieved until one was overtaken by the torment
				itself."
			</p>
			<p>
				Likewise, after citing admonitory precedents from the
				history of the former nations, the disbelievers at Makkah
				have been addressed and warned to this effect: "If you
				too adopt the same attitude and conduct for which the
				other nations have already been punished, why will you
				not be punished for it?Are you in any way a superior
				people that you should be treated differently from
				others? Or, have you received a deed of amnesty that you
				will not be punished for the crime for which others have
				been punished?And if you feel elated at your great
				numbers, you will soon see that these very numbers of
				yours are put to rout (on the battlefield) and on the Day
				of Resurrection you will be dealt with even more
				severely."
			</p>
			<p>
				In the end, the disbelievers have been told that Allah
				does not need to make lengthy preparations to bring about
				Resurrection. No sooner does He give a simple command for
				it than it will take place immediately. Like everything
				else the Universe and mankind also have a destiny.
				According to this destiny everything happens at its own
				appointed time. It cannot be so that whenever somebody
				gives a challenge, Resurrection is brought about in order
				to convince him. If you adopt rebellion because you do
				not see it coming, you will only be adding to your own
				distress and misfortune. For your record which is being
				prepared by Divine agents, has not left any misdeed of
				yours, great or small, unrecorded.

				This Surah is entitled Ar Rahman, the word with which it
				begins. This title, however, deeply relates to the
				subject matter of the Surah too, for in it, from the
				beginning to the end, the manifestations and fruits of
				Allah's attribute of mercy and grace have been mentioned.

		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				The commentators generally hold the view that this is a
				Makki Surah, though according to some traditions which
				have been cited on the authority of Hadrat Abdullah bin
				Abbas, Ikrimah and Qatadah, it was revealed at Madinah.
				But, firstly, there are also some other traditions from
				these very authorities, which contradict this view;
				secondly, its subject matter bears a closer resemblance
				with the Makki Surahs than with the Madani Surahs; rather
				it appears to belong to the very early Makkah period.
				However, there are several authentic traditions which
				testify that it had been revealed in Makkah itself many
				years before the hijra.
			</p>
			<p>
				Musnad Ahmad contains a tradition from Hadrat Asma,
				daughter of Abu Bakr (may Allah bless them both), to the
				effect: "I saw the Messenger of Allah offering his
				Prayers in the sacred precincts of the Ka'bah facing the
				corner in which the "Black Stone" is fixed. This relates
				to the time when the Divine Command, fasda bi-ma tumar
				("So, proclaim publicly, O Prophet, what you are being
				commanded") had not yet been revealed. The polytheists at
				that time were hearing the words, Fa-biayyi alaa'i Rabbi
				kuma tukadhdhi ban, being recited by him in the Prayer."
				This shows than this Surah had been sent down even before
				Surah Al-Hijr.
			</p>
			<p>
				Al-Bazzar, Ibn Jarir, Ibn Al-Mundhir, Daraqutni (in Al
				Afrad), Ibn Marduyah and Ibn Al Khatib (in At- Tarikh)
				have related, on the authority of Hadrat Abdullah bin
				Umar, that once the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of
				Allah be upon him) recited Surah Ar-Rahman himself, or
				heard it recited before him: then he said to the people:
				How is it that I am not hearing from you the kind of good
				answer that the jinn had given to their Lord? When the
				people asked what it was he replied: "As I recited the
				Divine Words, Fa bi-ayyi alaa'i Rabbi-kuma tukadhdhiban,
				the jinn in response would repeat the words La bi shai'in
				min ni'mati Rabbi-na nukadhdhib: 'We do not deny any of
				our Lord's blessings'."
			</p>
			<p>
				A similar theme has been related by Tirmidhi, Hakim and
				Hafiz Abu Bakr al-Bazzar from Hadrat Jabir bin Abdullah.
				Their tradition contains these words: "When the people
				kept silent on hearing the Surah Ar-Rahman, the Holy
				Prophet said, 'I recited this very Surah before the jinn
				in the night when they had gathered together to hear the
				Quran. They responded to it better than you have. As I
				recited the Divine Words, Fa bi ayyi alaa'i Rabbikuma
				tukadhdhiban ("O jinn and men, which blessings of your
				Lord will you deny?") they would respond to it, saying:
				"O our Lord, do not deny any of your blessings Praise is
				for You alone" '!"
			</p>
			<p>
				This tradition indicates that on the occasion of the
				incident that bas been related in Surah Al Ahqaf (vv. 29-
				32) of the jinn's hearing the Quran from the Holy Prophet
				(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him); he was
				reciting Surah Ar Rahman in the Prayer. This happened in
				the 10th year of the Prophethood when the Holy Prophet
				had halted at Makkah on his way back from Ta'if. Although
				in some other traditions it has been reported that the
				Holy Prophet did not know then that the jinn were hearing
				him recite the Quran, but afterwards Allah had informed
				him of this, it is not unreasonable to suppose that just
				as Allah had informed him of the jinn's hearing the Quran
				so also Allah Himself might have told him as to what
				answer they were giving on hearing Surah Ar Rahman.
			</p>
			<p>
				These traditions only indicate that Surah Ar Rahman had
				been revealed even before Surahs Al-Hijr and Al-Ahqaf.
				Besides, we come across another tradition which shows
				that it is one of those Surahs which were the earliest
				Revelations at Makkah. Ibn Ishaq has related this on the
				authority of Hadrat Urwah bin Zubair: The Companions one
				day said to one another: "The Quraish have never heard
				any one recite the Quran publicly to them, and who would
				read out the Divine Word aloud to them? Hadrat Abdullah
				bin Masud said that he would. The Companions expressed
				the apprehension that he might be subjected to a harsh
				treatment and said that it should better be done by a
				person of a powerful family, who would protect him if the
				Quraish tried to subject him to violence. Hadrat Abdullah
				said: 'Let me alone: my Protector is Allah.' So early
				next morning he went to the Ka'bah while the Quraish
				chiefs were sitting in their respective conferences.
				Hadrat Abdullah arrived at the Maqam (station of Abraham)
				and began to recite Surah Ar-Rahman raising his voice as
				he did so. The Quraish first tried for a while to
				understand what he was saying. Then, when they realized
				that it was the Word that Muhammad (peace and blessings
				of Allah be upon him) was representing as the Word of
				God, they fell upon him and began to hit him in the face.
				But Hadrat Abdullah was not deterred: he continued to
				receive the slaps and to read the Quran as long as he
				could. At last, when he returned with a swollen face, the
				Companions said that they apprehended the same. He
				replied: 'God's enemies were never so light for me as
				they were today. If you say I'll recite the Quran to them
				again tomorrow.' They all said, 'No, you have done
				enough; you have made them listen to what they didn't
				want to hear.'" (Ibn Hisham, vol. 1, p. 336).

		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				This is the only Surah of the Quran in which besides men
				the jinn also, who are the other creation of the earth
				endowed with freedom of will and action, have been
				directly addressed, and both men and jinn have been made
				to realize the wonders of Allah's power, His countless
				blessings, their own helplessness and accountability
				before Him, and have been warned of the evil consequences
				of His disobedience and made aware of the best results of
				His obedience. Although at several other places in the
				Quran there are clear pointers to show that like the men
				the jinn too are a creation who have been endowed with
				freedom of will and action and are accountable, who have
				been granted the freedom of belief and unbelief, of
				obedience and disobedience, and among them too there are
				the believers and the unbelievers, the obedient and the
				rebellious, as among human beings, and among them too
				there exist such groups as have believed in the Prophets
				sent by God and in the Divine Books, this Surah clearly
				points out that the message of the Holy Prophet (peace
				and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Quran is
				meant both for men and for jinn and that his Prophethood
				is not restricted to human beings alone.
			</p>
			<p>
				Although in the beginning of the Surah the address is
				directed only to human beings, for to them only belongs
				the vicegerency of the earth, among them only have the
				Messengers of Allah been raised, and in their tongues
				only have the Divine Books been revealed, yet from verse
				13 onward both the men and the jinn have been addressed
				and one and the same invitation has been extended to
				both.

				The Surah takes its name from the word al-waqi'ah of the
				very first verse.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				According to the chronological order that Hadrat Abdullah
				bin Abbas has given of the Surahs, first Surah Ta Ha was
				sent down, then Al-Waqi'ah and then Ash-Shuara. The same
				sequence has been reported from Ikrimah. This is
				supported also by the story that Ibn Hisham has related
				from Ibn Ishaq about the affirmation of the Faith by
				Hadrat Umar (may Allah be pleased with him). It says that
				when Hadrat Umar entered his sister's house, Surah Ta Ha
				was being recited. Hearing his voice the people of the
				house hid the pages of the Quran. Hadrat Umar first
				seized his brother-in-law and then his sister rose in
				defense of her husband, he hit her also and wounded her
				on the head. When Umar saw blood on his sister, he was
				sorry for what he had done, and said to her: "Show me the
				manuscript that you have concealed so that I may see what
				it contains." The sister said: "You are unclean because
				of your polytheism: Only a clean person can touch it."
				So, Hadrat Umar rose and washed himself, and then took up
				the manuscript to read it. This shows that Surah
				Al-Waqi'ah had been sent down by that time for it
				contains the verse: La yamassu hu ill al mutahharun; and
				it had been established historically that Hadrat Umar
				embraced Islam after the first migration to Habash, in
				the fifth year of the Prophethood.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				Its theme is the Hereafter, Tauhid and refutation of the
				Makkan disbelievers' suspicions about the Quran. What
				they regarded as utterly incredible was that Resurrection
				would ever take place, then the entire system of the
				earth and heavens would be upset, and when all the dead
				would be resurrected and called to account, after which
				the righteous would be admitted to Paradise and the
				wicked cast into Hell. They regarded all this as
				imaginary, which could not possibly happen in actual
				fact. In answer to this, it was said: "When the
				inevitable event will take place, there will be none to
				belie its happening, nor will anyone have the Power to
				avert it, nor prove it to be an unreal happening. At that
				time all peoples will be divided into three classes: 
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					The foremost in rank and position; 
				</li>
				<li>
					The common righteous people;
				</li>
				<li>
					Those who denied the Hereafter and persisted in
					disbelief and polytheism and major sins till the
					last. 
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				How these three classes of the people will be rewarded
				and punished has been described in detail in vv. 7-56.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, in vv. 57-74 arguments have been given, one after
				the other, to prove the truth of the two basic doctrines
				of Islam, which the disbelievers were refusing to accept,
				viz. the doctrines of Tauhid and the Hereafter. In these
				arguments, apart from everything else that exists in the
				earth and heavens, man's attention has been drawn to his
				own body and to the food that he eats and to the water
				that he drinks and to the fire on which he cooks his
				food, and he has been invited to ponder the question:
				What right do you have to behave independently of, or
				serve any other than, the God Whose creative power has
				brought you into being, and Whose provisions sustain you?
				And how can you entertain the idea that after having once
				brought you into existence He has become so helpless and
				powerless that He cannot recreate you once again even if
				he wills to?
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, in vv. 75-82 their suspicions in respect of the
				Quran have been refuted and they have been made to
				realize how fortunate they are that instead of deriving
				any benefit from the great blessing that the Quran is,
				they are treating it with scant attention and have set
				only this share of theirs in it that they deny it. If one
				seriously considers this matchless argument that has been
				presented in two brief sentences about the truth of the
				Quran, one will find in it the same kind of firm and
				stable system as exists among the stars and planets of
				the Universe, and the same is the proof of the fact that
				its Author is the same Being Who has created the
				Universe. Then the disbelievers have been told that this
				Book is inscribed in that Writ of Destiny which is beyond
				the reach of the creatures, as if to say "You think it is
				brought down by the devils to Muhammad (peace and
				blessings of Allah be upon him), whereas none but the
				pure angels has any access to the means by which it
				reaches Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon
				him) from the well guarded Tablet."
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, man has been warned, as if to say: "You
				may brag and boast as you like and may shut your eyes to
				the truths in your arrogance of independence, but death
				is enough to open your eyes. At death you become
				helpless: you cannot save your own parents; you cannot
				save your children; you cannot save your religious guided
				and beloved leaders. They all die in front of your very
				eyes while you look on helplessly. If there is no supreme
				power ruling over you, and your this assumption is
				correct that you are all in all in the world, and there
				is no God, then why don't you restore to the dying person
				his soul? Just as you are helpless in this, so it is also
				beyond your power to stop Allah from calling the people
				to account and mete out rewards and punishments to them.
				You may or may not believe it, but every dying person
				will surely see his own end after death. If he belongs to
				those nearest to God, he will see the good end meant for
				them if he be from among the righteous, he will see the
				end prepared for the righteous; and if he be from among
				the deniers of the truth, he will see the end destined
				for the criminals.

				The Surah takes its title from the sentence, Wa anzalna'
				l-hadida, of verse 25.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				This is unanimously a Madani Surah, and a study of its
				subject matter shows that it was probably sent down some
				time during the interval between the Battle of Uhud and
				the Truce of Hudaibiyah. This was the time when the tiny
				Islamic State of Madinah had been hemmed in by the
				disbelievers and the handful of the ill equipped Muslims
				were entrenched against the combined power of entire
				Arabia. In this state Islam not only stood in need of the
				sacrifice of Life from its followers, but it also needed
				monetary help and assistance. In this Surah a forceful
				appeal has been made for the same. This view is further
				strengthened by verse 10 in which Allah has addressed the
				believers to the effect: "Those of you who would spend
				and fight after the victory can never be equal to those
				who have spent and fought before the victory." And the
				same is supported by the traditions that Ibn Marduyah has
				related on the authority of Hadrat Anas. In respect of
				the verse Alam ya'n-i lilladhina aamanu an takhsha'a
				qulubu- hum li-dhikrillah-i, he says that 17 years after
				the commencement of the revelation of the Quran this
				verse was sent down to arouse the believers to action.

		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				The theme of this Surah is to exhort the Muslims to spend
				in the cause of Allah. At the most critical juncture of
				the history of Islam when it was engaged in a life and
				death struggle against Arab paganism, this Surah was
				revealed to persuade the Muslim's to make monetary
				sacrifices in particular, and to make them realize that
				Islam did not merely consist in verbal affirmation and
				some outward practices but its essence and spirit is
				sincerity towards Allah and His Religion. The faith of
				the one who was devoid of this spirit and who regarded
				his own self and wealth as dearer to himself than Allah
				and His Religion, was hollow and therefore of little
				worth in the sight of Allah. For this object, first the
				attributes of Allah Almighty have been mentioned so that
				the listeners may fully realize as to Who is addressing
				them. Then, the following themes have been expressed in
				sequence:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					The inevitable demand of the Faith is that one
					should not shirk spending one's wealth for the
					sake of Allah. This would not only be contrary to
					the Faith but also wrong realistically. For the
					wealth indeed belongs to Allah, on which man has
					been given proprietary rights only as His
					vicegerent. Yesterday this wealth was in other
					people's possession; today it is with one
					particular man, and tomorrow it will pass into
					some one else's hand. Ultimately, it will go back
					to Allah, Who is the inheritor of everything in
					the universe. Only that much of this wealth will
					be of any use to a man, which he spends in the
					cause of Allah during the period it is in his
					possession.
				</li>
				<li>
					Although making sacrifices for the sake of Allah
					is commendable in any case, the true worth of
					these sacrifices is determined by the nature of
					the occasion. There is an occasion when the power
					of paganism is overwhelming and there is a danger
					that it might subdue and overcome Islam
					completely; there is another occasion when Islam
					is in a stronger position in its struggle against
					un-Islam and the believers are attaining
					victories. Both these states are not equal as
					regards their respective importance. Therefore,
					the sacrifices that are made in these different
					states would also not be equal. Those who
					sacrifice their lives and expend their wealth to
					further promote the cause of Islam when it is
					already strong cannot attain to the rank of those
					who struggled with their lives and their wealth
					to promote and uphold the cause of Islam when it
					was weak.
				</li>
				<li>
					Whatever is spent for the cause of the Truth is a
					loan on Allah, and Allah will not only return it
					increasing it manifold but will also give from
					Himself the best reward for it.
				</li>
				<li>
					In the Hereafter the Light shall be bestowed only
					on those believers who would have spent their
					wealth in the cause of Allah. As for the
					hypocrites who watched and served only their own
					interests in the world, and who least bothered
					whether the Truth or falsehood prevailed will be
					segregated from the believers in the Hereafter
					although they might have lived in close
					association with them in the world. They will be
					deprived of the Light, and they will be counted
					among the disbelievers.
				</li>
				<li>
					The Muslims should not behave like those
					followers of the earlier Books, whose lives have
					been. spent in the worship of the world and whose
					hearts have become hardened due to negligence
					with the passage of time. He cannot be a believer
					whose heart does not melt at the remembrance of
					Allah and does not bow to the Truth sent down by
					Him.
				</li>
				<li>
					The sincere upholders of the Truth and the true
					witnesses of the Faith in the sight of Allah are
					only those believers who spend their wealth in
					His way sincerely, without any desire of show.
				</li>
				<li>
					The life of this world is only a short lived
					spring and a means of pride and show. Its sports
					and pastimes, its adornments and decorations, its
					pride of place, its wealth and possessions, for
					which the people try to vie with one another, are
					transient. Its likeness is of the crop which
					flourishes and blooms, then turns pale and then
					finally is reduced to chaff. The everlasting life
					is the life hereafter when results of great
					consequence will be announced. Therefore, if one
					has to vie with another for something, one should
					strive for Paradise.
				</li>
				<li>
					Whatever good man meets with and whatever
					hardship he suffers in the world, are preordained
					by Allah. A true believer is he who does not lose
					heart in affliction and is not puffed up with
					pride in good times. It is the character of a
					hypocrite and disbeliever that he is puffed up
					with pride when Allah favors him with His
					blessings, behaved boastfully and shows
					stinginess when called upon to spend in the cause
					of the same God Who blessed him, and also
					counsels others to be stingy like himself.
				</li>
				<li>
					Allah sent His Messengers with clear signs and
					the Book and the Law of Justice so that the
					people may adhere to justice; besides, He sent
					down iron also so that power may be used to
					establish the Truth and vanquish falsehood. Thus,
					Allah likes to see as to who from among the
					people would rise to support and succor His true
					Religion even at the risk of their lives. These
					opportunities Allah has created for man's own
					advantage and development; otherwise Allah does
					not stand in need of others for His works.
				</li>
				<li>
					Prophets came from Allah in the past, and by
					their preaching some people adopted the Right
					Path, but most of them persisted in wickedness.
					Then the Prophet Jesus came, whose teachings
					brought about many moral improvements in the
					lives of the people, but his community invented
					monasticism. Now Allah has sent the Prophet
					Muhammad (upon whom be His peace and blessings).
					Those who affirm faith in him and pass their life
					fearing Allah's accountability, will be given by
					Allah a double share of His mercy and He will
					bless them with the Light by which they will see
					and walk the straight path among the crooked
					paths met with at every step in the life of this
					world. Although the followers of the earlier
					revelation regard themselves as the monopolists
					of Allah's bounties, the fact remains that Allah
					Himself controls His bounties He may bless with
					these whomever He pleases.

			<p>
				This Surah is entitled Al Mujadalah as well as Mujadilah,
				the title being derived from the word tujadiluka of the
				very first verse. As at the outset mention has been made
				of the woman who pleaded with the Holy Prophet (upon whom
				be Allah's peace) the case of zihar pronounced by her
				husband and urged him to suggest a way out of the
				difficult situation in order to save her and, her
				children's life from ruin, and Allah has described her
				pleading by the word "mujadalah", the Surah came to be
				known by this very title. If it is read as "mujadalah" it
				would mean "pleading and arguing", and if it is read as
				"mujadilah", it would mean "the woman who pleaded and
				argued."
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				There is no tradition to tell as to when this incident of
				pleading and arguing took place, but there is a hint in
				the subject matter of the Surah on the basis of which it
				can be said with certainty that it happened some time
				after the battle of the Trench (Shawwal, 5 A.H.). In
				Surah Al-Ahzab, Allah while negating that an adopted son
				could be one's real son, had just said this and no more;
				"And Allah has not made those of your wives whom you
				divorce by zihar your mothers." But in that Surah there
				was nothing to the effect that to divorce a wife by zihar
				was a sin or a crime, nor anything about the legal
				injunction concerning it. Contrary to it, in this Surah
				the whole law relating to zihar has been laid down, which
				shows that these detailed injunctions were sent down some
				time after the brief reference to it in Surah Al-Ahzab.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Subject Matter and Topics">
			<p>
				In this Surah instructions have been given to the Muslims
				about the different problems that confronted them at that
				time. From the beginning of the Surah to verse 6 legal
				injunctions about zihar have been given, along with which
				the Muslims have been strictly warned that it is contrary
				to their profession of the Faith that they should still
				persist in the practices of ignorance after they have
				accepted Islam, that they should break the bounds set by
				Allah, or refuse to abide by them, or that they should
				make their own rules and regulations contradictory to
				them. For this there is not only the punishment of
				disgrace and humiliation in the world but in the
				Hereafter too there will be strict accountability for it.
			</p>
			<p>
				In vv. 7-10 the hypocrites have been taken to task for
				their secret whisperings and consultations by which they
				conspired and intrigued against the "Holy Prophet (upon
				whom be Allah's peace and blessings), and because of
				their hidden malice and grudge greeted him, like the
				Jews, in a manner as to wish him ill instead of well. In
				this connection, the Muslims have been consoled, as if to
				say: "These whisperings of the hypocrites can do no harm
				to you; therefore, you should go on doing your duty with
				full trust in Allah". Besides, they have also been taught
				this moral lesson: "The true believers, when they talk
				secretly together, do not talk of sin and transgression
				and disobedience to the Messenger if they have to talk
				secretly together they should talk of goodness and
				piety."
			</p>
			<p>
				In vv. 11-13 the Muslims have been taught certain manners
				of social behavior and given instructions to eradicate
				certain social evils which were prevalent among the
				people then as they are today. If some people are sitting
				in an assembly, and more people arrive, they do not show
				even the courtesy as to squeeze in so as to make room for
				others, with the result that the new-comers have to keep
				standing, or to sit in the door-way, or to go back, or
				seeing that there is enough room yet start jumping over
				the people's heads to find room for themselves. This
				often used to be experienced in the Holy Prophet's
				assemblies. Therefore, Allah gave the instruction, as if
				to say: "Do not behave selfishly and narrow mindedly in
				your assemblies but do accommodate the new-comers also
				with an open heart."
			</p>
			<p>
				Likewise, another vice found among the people is that
				when they go on a visit to somebody (an important person,
				in particular), they prolong their sitting and do not at
				all mind that encroaching upon his time unduly would
				cause him hardship. Then, if he tells them to leave, they
				mind it; if he himself rises up from their assembly, they
				complain of his lack of manners; if he tells them
				indirectly that he has some other business also to attend
				to, for which he needs time, they turn a deaf ear to his
				request. The Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace)
				himself also had to experience such misconduct of the
				people, who in their earnestness to benefit by his
				teaching did not at all see that they were wasting his
				precious time so badly needed for other important works.
				At last, Allah in order to eradicate this bad manner,
				enjoined that when the people are asked to rise up from
				an assembly, they should rise up and disperse.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another vice prevalent among the people was that each
				person wished to have secret counsel individually with
				the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) without any
				real need, or would like that he should approach him
				during an assembly and whisper something to him. This was
				not only embarrassing for the Holy Prophet but also
				annoying for the people who sat in the assembly. That is
				why Allah imposed the restriction that anyone who wanted
				to consult him in private, should first give away
				something in charity. The object was that the people
				should be warned of this bad manner and made to give it
				up. Thus, the restriction was kept in force for a short
				while, and when the people had corrected their behavior,
				it was withdrawn.
			</p>
			<p>
				From verse 14 to the end of the Surah members of the
				Muslim society, which was a mixture of the sincere
				Muslims and the hypocrites and the waverers, have been
				told plainly as to what is the criterion of sincerity in
				Islam. One kind of Muslims are those who are friends with
				the enemies of Islam: they do not hesitate for the sake
				of their interests to be treacherous to the religion
				which they profess to believe in; they spread all sorts
				of doubts and suspicions against Islam and prevent the
				people from adopting the Way of Allah. But since they are
				part of the Muslim community their false profession of
				Faith serves them as a cover and shield. The second kind
				of Muslims are those who, in the matter of Allah's
				Religion, do not care even for their own father, brother,
				children, and family, to say nothing of others. They do
				not cherish any feeling of love for the person who is an
				enemy of God and His Messenger and His Religion. Allah in
				these verses has explicitly stated that the people of the
				first kind, in fact, belong to Satan's party however hard
				they may try to convince others of their Islam by
				swearing oaths. And the honor of belonging to Allah's
				party is possessed only by the Muslims of the second
				kind. They alone are the true Muslims: they alone will
				attain to true success, and with them alone is Allah well
				pleased.

				The Surah derives its name from the mention of the word
				al-hashr in verse thereby implying that it is the Surah
				in which the word al-hashr has occurred.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				Bukhari and Muslim contain a tradition from Hadrat Sa'id
				bin Jubair to the effect "When I asked Hadrat Abdullah
				bin Abbas about Surah Al-Hashr, he replied that it was
				sent down concerning the battle against the Bani an-Nadir
				just as Surah Al-Anfal was sent down concerning the
				Battle of Badr. In another tradition from Hadrat Sa'id
				bin Jubair, the words cited from Ibn Abbas (may Allah be
				pleased with him) are: Qul: surah an-Nadir: Say, it is
				Surah an-Nadir." The same thing has been related also
				from Mujahid, Qatadah, Zuhri, Ibn Zaid, Yazid bin Ruman,
				Muhammad bin Ishaq and others. They are unanimous that
				the followers of the Book whose banishment has been
				mentioned in it, imply the Bani an-Nadir. Yazid bin
				Ruman, Mujahid and Muhammad bin Ishaq have stated that
				this whole Surah, from beginning to end, came down
				concerning this very battle.
			</p>
			<p>
				As for the question as to when this battle took place,
				Imam Zuhri has stated on the authority of Urwah bin
				Zubair that it took place six months after the Battle of
				Badr. However, Ibn Sa'd, Ibn Hisham and Baladhuri regard
				it as an event of Rabi' al-Awwal, A.H. 4, and the same is
				correct. For all traditions agree that this battle took
				place after the incident of Bi'r Ma'unah, and
				historically also it is well known that the incident of
				Bir Ma'unah occurred after the Battle of Uhud and not
				before it.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Historical Background">
			<p>
				In order to understand the subject matter of this Surah
				well, it is necessary to have a look at the history of
				the Madinah and Hejaz Jews, for without it one cannot
				know precisely the real causes of the Holy Prophet's
				dealing with their different tribes the way he did.
			</p>
			<p>
				No authentic history of the Arabian Jews exists in the
				world. They have not left any writing of their own in the
				form of a book or a tablet which might throw light on
				their past, nor have the Jewish historians and writers of
				the non-Arab world made any mention of them, the reason
				being that after their settlement in the Arabian
				peninsula they had detached themselves from the main body
				of the nation, and the Jews of the world did not count
				them as among themselves. For they had given up Hebrew
				culture and language, even the names, and adopted Arabism
				instead. In the tablets that have been unearthed in the
				archaeological research in the Hejaz no trace of the Jews
				is found before the first century of the Christian era,
				except for a few Jewish names. Therefore, the history of
				the Arabian Jews is based mostly on the verbal traditions
				prevalent among the Arabs most of which bad been spread
				by the Jews themselves.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Jews of the Hejaz claimed that they had come to
				settle in Arabia during the last stage of the life of the
				Prophet Moses (peace be upon him). They said that the
				Prophet Moses had despatched an army to expel the
				Amalekites from the land of Yathrib and had commanded it
				not to spare even a single soul of that tribe. The
				Israelite army carried out the Prophet's command, but
				spared the life of a handsome prince of the Amalekite
				king and returned with him to Palestine. By that time the
				Prophet Moses had passed sway. His successors took great
				exception to what the army had done, for by sparing the
				life of an Amalekite it had clearly disobeyed the Prophet
				and violated the Mosaic law. Consequently, they excluded
				the army from their community, and it had to return to
				Yathrib and settle there for ever.(Kitab al-Aghani, vol.
				xix, p. 94). Thus the Jews claimed that they had been
				living in Yathrib since about 1200 B.C. But, this had in
				fact no historical basis and probably the Jews had
				invented this story in order to overawe the Arabs into
				believing that they were of noble lineage and the
				original inhabitants of the land.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second Jewish immigration, according to the Jews,
				took, place in 587 B.C. when Nebuchadnezzer, the king of
				Babylon, destroyed Jerusalem and dispersed the Jews
				throughout the world. The Arab Jews said that several of
				their tribes at that time had come to settle in Wadi
				al-Qura, Taima, and Yathrib.(Al-Baladhuri, Futuh
				al-Buldan). But this too has no historical basis. By this
				also they might have wanted to prove that they were the
				original settlers of the area.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a matter of fact, what is established is that when in
				A.D. 70 the Romans massacred the Jews in Palestine, and
				then in A.D. 132 expelled them from that land, many of
				the Jewish tribes fled to find an asylum in the Hejaz, a
				territory that was contiguous to Palestine in the south.
				There, they settled wherever they found water springs and
				greenery, and then by intrigue and through money lending
				business gradually occupied the fertile lands. Ailah,
				Maqna, Tabuk, Taima, Wadi al Qura, Fadak and Khaiber came
				under their control in that very period, and Banl
				Quraizah, Bani al-Nadir, Bani Bahdal, and Bani Qainuqa
				also came in the same period and occupied Yathrib.
			</p>
			<p>
				Among the tribes that settled in Yathrib the Bani al
				Nadir and the Bani Quraizah were more prominent for they
				belonged to the Cohen or priest class. They were looked
				upon as of noble descent and enjoyed religious leadership
				among their co-religionists. When they came to settle in
				Madinah there were some other tribes living there before,
				whom they subdued and became practically the owners of
				this green and fertile land. About three centuries later,
				in A. D. 450 or 451, the great flood of Yaman occurred
				which has been mentioned in vv. 16-17 of Surah Saba
				above. As a result of this different tribes of the people
				of Saba were compelled to leave Yaman and disperse in
				different parts of Arabia. Thus, the Bani Ghassan went to
				settle in Syria, Bani Lakhm in Hirah (Iraq), Bani Khuzaah
				between Jeddah and Makkah and the Aus and the Khazraj
				went to settle in Yathrib. As Yathrib was under Jewish
				domination, they at first did not allow the Aus and the
				Khazraj to gain a footing and the two Arab tribes had to
				settle on lands that had not yet been brought under
				cultivation, where they could hardly produce just enough
				to enable them to survive. At last, one of their chiefs
				went to Syria to ask for the assistance of their
				Ghassanide brothers; he brought an army from there and
				broke the power of the Jews. Thus, the Aus and the
				Khazraj were able to gain complete dominance over
				Yathrib, with the result that two of the major Jewish
				tribes, Bani an-Nadir and Bani Quraizaha were forced to
				take quarters outside the city. Since the third tribe,
				Bani Qainuqa, was not on friendly terms with the other
				two tribes, it stayed inside the city as usual, but had
				to seek protection of the Khazraj tribe. As a counter
				measure to this Bani an-Nadir and Bani Quraizah took
				protection of the Aus tribe so that they could live in
				peace in the suburbs of Yathrib.
			</p>
			<p>
				Before the Holy Prophet's arrival at Madinah until his
				emigration the following were the main features of the
				Jews' position in Hejaz in general and in Yathrib in
				particular
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					In the matter of language, dress, civilization
					and way of life they had completely adopted
					Arabism, even their names had become Arabian. Of
					the 12 Jewish tribes that had settled in Hejaz,
					none except the Bani Zaura retained its Hebrew
					name. Except for a few scattered scholars none
					knew Hebrew. In fact, there is nothing in the
					poetry of the Jewish poets of the pre-Islamic
					days to distinguish it from the poetry of the
					Arab poets in language, ideas and themes. They
					even intermarried with the Arabs. In fact,
					nothing distinguished them from the common Arabs
					except religion. Notwithstanding this, they had
					not lost their identity among the Arabs and had
					kept their Jewish prejudice alive most ardently
					and jealously. They had adopted superficial
					Arabism because they could not survive in Arabia
					without it.
				</li>
				<li>
					Because of this Arabism the western orientals
					have been misled into thinking that perhaps they
					were not really Israelites but Arabs who had
					embraced Judaism, or that at least majority of
					them consisted of the Arab Jews. But there is no
					historical proof to show that the Jews ever
					engaged in any proselytizing activities in Hejaz,
					or their rabbis invited the Arabs to embrace
					Judaism like the Christian priests and
					missionaries. On the contrary, we see that they
					prided themselves upon their Israelite descent
					and racial prejudices. They called the Arabs the
					Gentiles, which did not mean illiterate or
					uneducated but savage and uncivilized people.
					They believed that the Gentiles did not possess
					any human rights; these were only reserved for
					the Israelites, and therefore, it was lawful and
					right for the Israelites to defraud them of their
					properties by every fair and foul means. Apart
					from the Arab chiefs, they did not consider the
					common Arabs fit enough to have equal status with
					them even if they entered Judaism. No historical
					proof is available, nor is there any evidence in
					the Arabian traditions, that some Arab tribe or
					prominent clan might have accepted Judaism.
					However, mention has been made of some
					individuals, who had become Jews. The Jews,
					however, were more interested in their trade and
					business than in the preaching of their religion.
					That is why Judaism did not spread as a religion
					and creed in Hejaz but remained only as a mark of
					pride and distinction of a few Israelite tribes.
					The Jewish rabbis, however, had a flourishing
					business in granting amulets and charms, fortune
					telling and sorcery, because of which they were
					held in great awe by the Arabs for their
					"knowledge" and practical wisdom.
				</li>
				<li>
					Economically they were much stronger than the
					Arabs. Since they had emigrated from more
					civilized and culturally advanced countries of
					Palestine and Syria, they knew many such arts as
					were unknown to the Arabs; they also enjoyed
					trade relations with the outside world. Hence,
					they had captured the business of importing grain
					in Yathrib and the upper Hejaz and exporting
					dried dates to other countries. Poultry farming
					and fishing also were mostly under their
					controls. They were good at cloth weaving too.
					They had also set up wine shops here and there,
					where they sold wine which they imported from
					Syria. The Bani Qainuqa generally practiced
					crafts such as that of the goldsmith, blacksmith
					and vessel maker. In all these occupations, trade
					and business these Jews earned exorbitant
					profits, but their chief occupation was trading
					in money lending in which they had ensnared the
					Arabs of the surrounding areas. More particularly
					the chiefs and elders of the Arab tribes who were
					given to a life of pomp, bragging and boasting on
					the strength of borrowed money were deeply
					indebted to them. They lent money on high rates
					of interest and then would charge compound
					interest, which one could hardly clear off once
					one was involved in it. Thus, they had rendered
					the Arabs economically hollow, but it had
					naturally induced a deep rooted hatred among the
					common Arabs against the Jews.
				</li>
				<li>
					The demand of their trade and economic interests
					was that they should neither estrange one Arab
					tribe by befriending another, nor take part in
					their mutual wars. But, on the other hand, it was
					also in their interests, that they should not
					allow the Arabs to be united and should keep them
					fighting and entrenched against each other, for
					they knew that whenever the Arab tribes united,
					they would not allow them to remain in possession
					of their 1arge properties, gardens and fertile
					lands, which they had come to own through their
					profiteering and money lending business.
					Furthermore, each of their tribes also had to
					enter into alliance with one or another powerful
					Arab tribe for the sake of its own protection so
					that no other powerful tribe should overawe it by
					its might. Because of this they had not only to
					take part in the mutual wars of the Arabs but
					they often had to go to war in support of the
					Arab tribe to which their tribe was tied in
					alliance against another Jewish tribe which was
					allied to the enemy tribe. In Yathrib the Bani
					Quraizah and the Bani an-Nadir were the allies of
					the Aus while the Bani Qainuqa of the Khazraj. A
					little before the Holy Prophet's emigration,
					these Jewish tribes had confronted each other in
					support of their respective allies in the bloody
					war that took place between the Aus and the
					Khazraj at Buath.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Such were the conditions when Islam came to Madinah, and
				ultimately an Islamic State came into existence after the
				Holy Prophet's (upon whom be Allah's peace) arrival
				there. One of the first things that he accomplished soon
				after establishing this state was unification of the Aus
				and the Khazraj and the Emigrants into a brotherhood, and
				the second was that he concluded a treaty between the
				Muslims and the Jews on definite conditions, in which it
				was pledged that neither party would encroach on the
				rights of the other, and both would unite in a joint
				defense against the external enemies. Some important
				clauses of this treaty are as follows, which clearly show
				what the Jews and the Muslims had pledged to adhere to in
				their mutual relationship:
			</p>
			<p>
				"The Jews must bear their expenses and the Muslims their
				expenses. Each must help the other against anyone who
				attacks the people of this document. They must seek
				mutual advice and consultation, and loyalty is a
				protection against treachery. They shall sincerely wish
				one another well. Their relations will be governed by
				piety and recognition of the rights of others, and not by
				sin and wrongdoing. The wronged must be helped. The Jews
				must pay with the believers so long as the war lasts.
				Yathrib shall be a sanctuary for the people of this
				document. If any dispute or controversy likely to cause
				trouble should arise, it must be referred to God and to
				Muhammad the Apostle of God; Quraish and their helpers
				shall not be given protection. The contracting parties
				are bound to help one another against any attack on
				Yathrib; Every one shall be responsible for the defense
				of the portion to which he belongs" (lbn Hisham, vol. ii,
				pp. 147 to 150).
			</p>
			<p>
				This was on absolute and definitive covenant to the
				conditions of which the Jews themselves had agreed. But
				not very long after this they began to show hostility
				towards the Holy Prophet of Allah (upon whom be Allah's
				peace) and Islam and the Muslims, and their hostility and
				perverseness went on increasing day by day. Its main
				causes were three:
			</p>
			<p>
				First, they envisaged the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
				Allah's peace) merely as a chief of his people, who
				should be content to have concluded a political agreement
				with them and should only concern himself with the
				worldly interests of his group. But they found that he
				was extending an invitation to belief in Allah and the
				Apostleship and the Book (which also included belief in
				their own Prophets and scriptures), and was urging the
				people to give up disobedience of Allah and adopt
				obedience to the Divine Commands and abide by the moral
				laws of their own prophets. This they could not put up
				with. They feared that if this universal ideological
				movement gained momentum it would destroy their rigid
				religiosity and wipe out their racial nationhood.
			</p>
			<p>
				Second, when they saw that the Aus and the Khazraj and
				the Emigrants were uniting into a brotherhood and the
				people from the Arab tribes of the surrounding areas, who
				entered Islam, were also joining this Islamic Brotherhood
				of Madinah and forming a religious community, they feared
				that the selfish policy that they had been following of
				sowing discord between the Arab tribes for the promotion
				of their own well being and interests for centuries,
				would not work in the new system, but they would face a
				united front of the Arabs against which their intrigues
				and machinations would not succeed.
			</p>
			<p>
				Third, the work that the Holy Messenger of Allah (upon
				whom be Allah's peace) was carrying out of reforming the
				society and civilization included putting an end to all
				unlawful methods in business and mutual dealings. More
				than that; he had declared taking and giving of interest
				also as impure and unlawful earning. This caused them the
				fear that if his rule became established in Arabia, he
				would declare interest legally forbidden, and in this
				they saw their own economic disaster and death.
			</p>
			<p>
				For these reasons they made resistance and opposition to
				the Holy Prophet their national ideal. They would never
				hesitate to employ any trick and machination, any device
				and cunning, to harm him. They spread every kind of
				falsehood so as to cause distrust against him in the
				people's minds. They created every kind of doubt,
				suspicion and misgiving in the hearts of the new converts
				so as to turn them back from Islam. They would make false
				profession of Islam and then would turn apostate so that
				it may engender more and more misunderstandings among the
				people against Islam and the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
				Allah's peace). They would conspire with the hypocrites
				to create mischief and would cooperate with every group
				and tribe hostile to Islam. They would create rifts
				between the Muslims and would do whatever they could to
				stir them up to mutual feuds and fighting. The people of
				the Aus and the Khazraj tribes were their special target,
				with whom they had been allied for centuries. Making
				mention of the war of Buath before them they would remind
				them of their previous enmities so that they might again
				resort to the sword against each other and shatter their
				bond of fraternity into which Islam had bound them. They
				would resort to every kind of deceit and fraud in order
				to harm the Muslims economically. Whenever one of those
				with whom they had business dealings, would accept Islam,
				they would do whatever they could to cause him financial
				loss. If he owed them something they would worry and
				harass him by making repeated demands, and if they owed
				him something, they would withhold the payment and would
				publicly say that at the time the bargain was made he
				professed a different religion, and since he had changed
				his religion, they were no longer under any obligation
				towards him. Several instances of this nature have been
				cited in the explanation of verse 75 of Surah Al Imran
				given in the commentaries by Tabari, Nisaburi, Tabrisi
				and in Ruh al Ma'ani.
			</p>
			<p>
				They had adopted this hostile attitude against the
				covenant even before the Battle of Badr. But when the
				Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) and the Muslims
				won a decisive victory over the Quraish at Badr, they
				were filled with grief and anguish, malice and anger.
				They were in fact anticipating that in that war the
				powerful Quraish would deal a death blow to the Muslims.
				That is why even before the news of the Islamic victory
				reached Madinah they had begun to spread the rumor that
				the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) had fallen
				a martyr and the Muslims had been routed, and the Quraish
				army under Abu Jahl was advancing on Madinah. But when
				the battle was decided against their hopes and wishes,
				they burst with anger and grief. Ka'b bin Ashraf, the
				chief of the Bani an-Nadir, cried out: "By God, if
				Muhammad has actually killed these nobles of Arabia, the
				earth's belly would be better for us than its back." Then
				he went to Makkah and incited the people to vengeance by
				writing and reciting provocative elegies for the Quraish
				chiefs killed at Badr. Then he returned to Madinah and
				composed lyrical verses of an insulting nature about the
				Muslim women. At last, enraged with his mischief, the
				Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) sent Muhammad
				bin Maslamah Ansari in Rabi al-Awwal, A. H. 3, and had
				him slain. Ibn Sad, Ibn Hisham, Tabari).
			</p>
			<p>
				The first Jewish tribe which, after the Battle of Badr,
				openly and collectively broke their covenant were the
				Bani Qainuqa. They lived in a locality inside the city of
				Madinah. As they practiced the crafts of the goldsmith,
				blacksmith and vessel maker, the people of Madinah had to
				visit their shops fairly frequently. They were proud of
				their bravery and valor. Being blacksmiths by profession
				even their children were well armed, and they could
				instantly muster 700 fighting men from among themselves.
				They were also arrogantly aware that they enjoyed
				relations of confederacy with the Khazraj and Abdullah
				bin Ubbay, the chief of the, Khazraj, was their chief
				supporter. At the victory of Badr, they became so
				provoked than they began to trouble and harass the
				Muslims and their women in particular, who visited their
				shops. By and by things came to such a pass that one day
				a Muslim woman was stripped naked publicly in their
				bazaar. This led to a brawl in which a Muslim and a Jew
				were killed. Thereupon the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
				Allah's peace) himself visited their locality, got them
				together and counseled them on decent conduct. But the
				reply that they gave was; "O Muhammad, you perhaps think
				we are like the Quraish; they did not know fighting;
				therefore, you overpowered them. But when you come in
				contact with us, you will see how men fight." This was in
				clear words a declaration of war. Consequently, the Holy
				Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) laid siege to their
				quarters towards the end of Shawwal (and according to
				some others, of Dhi Qa'dah) A.H. 2. The siege had hardly
				lasted for a fortnight when they surrendered and all
				their fighting men were tied and taken prisoners. Now
				Abdullah bin Ubayy came up in support of them and
				insisted that they should be pardoned. The Holy Prophet
				conceded his request and decided that the Bani Qainuqa
				would be exiled from Madinah leaving their properties,
				armor and tools of trade be- hind.(Ibn Sa'd, Ibn Hisham,
				Tarikh Tabari).
			</p>
			<p>
				For some time after these punitive measures (i.e. the
				banishment of the Qainuqa and killing of Ka'b bin Ashraf
				the Jews remained so terror stricken that they did not
				dare commit any further mischief. But later when in
				Shawwal, A. H. 3, the Quraish in order to avenge
				themselves for the defeat at Badr, marched against
				Madinah with great preparations, and the Jews saw that
				only a thousand men had marched out with the Holy Prophet
				(upon whom be Allah's peace) as against three thousand
				men of the Quraish, and even they were deserted by 300
				hypocrites who returned to Madinah, they committed the
				first and open breach of the treaty by refusing to join
				the Holy Prophet in the defense of the city although they
				were bound to it. Then, when in the Battle of Uhud the
				Muslims suffered reverses, they were further emboldened.
				So much so that the Bani an-Nadir made a secret plan to
				kill the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace),
				though the plan failed before it could be executed.
				According to the details, after the incident of Bi'r
				Maunah (Safar, A.H. 4) Amr bin Umayyah Damri slew by
				mistake two men of the Bani Amir in retaliation, who
				actually belonged to a tribe which was allied to the
				Muslims, but Amr had mistaken them for the men of the
				enemy. Because of this mistake their blood money became
				obligatory on the Muslims. Since the Bani an-Nadir were
				also a party in the alliance with the Bani Amir, the Holy
				Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) went to their clan
				along with some of his Companions to ask for their help
				in paying the blood money. Outwardly they agreed to
				contribute, as he wished, but secretly they plotted that
				a person should go up to the top of the house by whose
				wall the Holy Prophet was sitting and drop a rock on him
				to kill him. But before they could execute their plan,
				Allah informed him in time and be immediately got up and
				returned to Madinah.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now there was no question of showing them any further
				concession. The Holy Prophet at once sent to them the
				ultimatum that the treachery they had meditated against
				him had come to his knowledge; therefore, they were to
				leave Madinah within ten days; if anyone of them was
				found staying behind in their quarters, he would be put
				to the sword. Meanwhile Abduliah bin Ubayy sent them the
				message that he would help them with two thousand men and
				that the Bani Quraizah and Bani Ghatafan also would come
				to their aid; therefore, they should stand firm and
				should not go. On this false assurance they responded to
				the Holy Prophet's ultimatum saying that they would not
				leave Madinah and he could do whatever was in his power.
				Consequently, in Rabi' al-Awwal, A.H. 4, the Holy Prophet
				(upon whom be Allah's peace) laid siege to them, and
				after a few days of the siege (which according to some
				traditions were 6 and according to others 15 days) they
				agreed to leave Madinah on the condition that they could
				retain all their property which they could carry on thee
				camels, except the armour. Thus, Madinah was rid of this
				second mischievous tribe of Jews. Only two of the Bani
				an-Nadir became Muslims and stayed behind. Others went to
				Syria and Khaiber.

		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				The theme of the Surah as stated above, is an appraisal
				of the battle against the Bani an Nadir. In this, on the
				whole, four things have been discussed.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					In the first four verses the world has been
					admonished to take heed of the fate that had just
					befallen the Bani an-Nadir. A major tribe which
					was as strong in numbers as the Muslims, whose
					people boasted of far more wealth and possession
					who were by no means ill-equipped militarily and
					whose forts were well fortified could not stand
					siege even for a few days, and expressed their
					readiness to accept banishment from their
					centuries-old, well established settlement even
					though not a single man from among them was
					slain. Allah says that this happened not because
					of any power possessed by the Muslims but because
					the Jews had tried to resist and fight Allah and
					His Messenger, and those who dare to resist the
					power of Allah, always meet with the same fate.
				</li>
				<li>
					In verse 5, the rule of the law of war that has
					been enunciated is: the destruction caused in the
					enemy territory for military purposes does not
					come under "spreading mischief in the earth."
				</li>
				<li>
					In vv. 6-10 it has been stated how the lands and
					properties which come under the control of the
					Islamic State as a result of war or peace terms,
					are to be managed. As it was the first ever
					occasion that the Muslims took control of a
					conquered territory, the law concerning it was
					laid down for their guidance.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				(4) In vv. 11-17 the attitude that the hypocrites had
				adopted on the occasion of the battle against the Bani
				an-Nadir has been reviewed and the causes underlying it
				have been pointed out.
			</p>
			<p>
				(5) The whole of the last section (vv. 18-24) is an
				admonition for all those people who had professed to have
				affirmed the faith and joined the Muslim community, but
				were devoid of the true spirit of the faith. In it they
				have been told what is the real demand of the Faith, what
				is the real difference between piety and wickedness, what
				is the place and importance of the Quran which they
				professed to believe in, and what are the attributes of
				God in Whom they claimed to have believed.
			</p>

	</sura>
	<sura num="60">
		<section heading="Name">
			<p>
				In verse 10 of this Surah it has been enjoined that the
				women who emigrate to dar al-Islam (the Islamic State)
				and claim to be Muslims, should be examined hence the
				title Al-Mumtahinah. The word is pronounced both as
				mumtahinah and as mumtahanah, the meaning according to
				the first pronunciation being "the Surah which examines",
				and according to the second, "the woman who is examined."
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				The Surah deals with two incidents, the time of the
				occurrence of which is well known historically. The first
				relates to Hadrat Hatib bin Abz Balta'a, who, a little
				before the conquest of Makkah, had sent a secret letter
				to the Quraish chiefs informing them of the Holy
				Prophet's intention to attack them. The second relates to
				the Muslim women, who had started emigrating from Makkah
				to Madinah, after the conclusion of the Truce of
				Hudaibiyah, and the problem arose whether they also were
				to be returned to the disbelievers, like the Muslim men,
				according to the conditions of the Truce. The mention of
				these two things absolutely determines that this Surah
				came down during the interval between the Truce of
				Hudaibiyah and the Conquest of Makkah. Besides, there is
				a third thing also that has been mentioned at the end of
				the Surah to the effect; What should the Holy Prophet
				(upon whom be Allah's peace) make the women to pledge
				when they come to take the oath of allegiance before him
				as believers?About this part also the guess is that this
				too was sent down some time before the conquest of
				Makkah, for after this conquest a large number of the
				Quraish women, like their men, were going to enter Islam
				simultaneously and had to be administered the oath of
				allegiance collectively.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Topics">
			<p>
				This Surah has three parts;
			</p>
			<p>
				The first part consists of vv. 1-9, and the concluding
				verse 13 also relates to it. In this strong exception has
				been taken to the act of Hadrat Hatib bin Abi Balta'a in
				that he had tried to inform the enemy of a very important
				war secret of the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's
				peace) only for the sake of safe guarding his family.
				This would have caused great bloodshed at the conquest of
				Makkah had it not been made ineffective in time. It would
				have cost the Muslims many precious lives; many of the
				Quraish would have been killed, who were to render great
				services to Islam afterward; the gains which were to
				accrue from conquering Makkah peacefully would have been
				lost, and all these serious losses would have resulted
				only because one of the Muslims had wanted to safeguard
				his family from the dangers of war. Administering a
				severe warning at this blunder Allah has taught the
				believers the lesson that no believer should, under any
				circumstances and for any motive, have relations of love
				and friendship with the disbelievers, who are actively
				hostile to Islam, and a believer should refrain from
				everything which might be helpful to them in the conflict
				between Islam and disbelief. However, there is no harm in
				dealing kindly and justly with those disbelievers, who
				may not be practically engaged in hostile activities
				against Islam and persecution of the Muslims.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second part consists of vv. 10-11. In this a social
				problem has been settled, which was agitating the minds
				at that time. There were many Muslim women in Makkah,
				whose husbands were pagans, but they were emigrating and
				reaching Madinah somehow. Likewise, there were many
				Muslim men in Madinah, whose wives were pagans and had
				been left behind in Makkah. The question arose whether
				the marriage bond between them continued to be valid or
				not. Allah settled this problem for ever, saying that the
				pagan husband is not lawful for the Muslim women, nor the
				pagan wife lawful for the Muslim husband. This decision
				leads to very important legal consequences, which we
				shall explain in our notes below.
			</p>
			<p>
				The third section consists of verse 12, in which the Holy
				Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) has been instructed
				to ask the women who accept Islam to pledge that they
				would refrain from the major evils that were prevalent
				among the womenfolk of the pre-Islamic Arab society, and
				to promise that they would henceforth follow the ways of
				goodness which the Messenger of Allah may enjoin.

	<sura num="61">
		<section heading="Name">
			<p>
				The Surah derives its name from the sentence yuqatiluna
				fi sabil-i-hi saff-an of verse 4; thereby implying that
				it is a Surah in which the word saff occurred.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				It could not be known from any reliable tradition, but a
				study of its subject-matter shows that this Surah
				probably was sent down in the period closely following
				the Battle of Uhud, for by reading between the lines
				perceives a clear description of the conditions that
				prevailed in that period.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				Its theme is to exhort the Muslims to adopt sincerity in
				Faith and to struggle with their lives in the cause of
				Allah. It is addressed to the Muslims with weak faith as
				well as those who had entered Islam with a false
				profession of the Faith and also those who were sincere
				in their profession. Some verses are addressed to the
				first two groups, some only to the hypocrites, and some
				only to the sincere Muslims. The style itself shows where
				one particular group has been addressed and where the
				other. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At the outset the believers have been warned to the
				effect; "Allah indeed hates those people who say one
				thing and do another, and He indeed loves those who fight
				in the cause of the Truth, standing like a solid
				structure, against the enemies of Allah."'
			</p>
			<p>
				In vv. 5-7 the people of the Holy Prophet's community
				have been warned that their attitude towards their
				Messenger and their Religion should not be like the
				attitude that the Israelites had adopted towards the
				Prophets Moses and Jesus (peace be upon them). In spite
				of acknowledging the Prophet Moses as a Messenger of God
				they continued to malign him as long as he lived, and in
				spite of witnessing clear signs from the Prophet Jesus
				they denied him without any hesitation. Consequently, the
				Israelites became perverse, incapable of benefiting from
				divine guidance. This is certainly not an enviable state
				which another nation should imitate. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, in vv. 8-9 a proclamation has been made with the
				challenge: "The Jews and the Christians, and the
				hypocrites, who are conspiring with them, may try however
				hard they may to extinguish this Light of Allah, it will
				shine forth and spread in the world in all its fullness,
				and the Religion brought by the true Messenger of Allah
				shall prevail over every other religion however hateful
				it may be to the pagans and polytheists. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In vv. 10-13, the believers have been told that the way
				to success both here and in the Hereafter is only one:
				that they should believe in Allah and His Messenger
				sincerely and should exert their utmost in Allah's Way
				with their selves and their wealth. As a reward for this
				they will earn immunity from Allah's punishment,
				forgiveness of their sins and the eternal Paradise in the
				Hereafter, and will be blessed with Allah's good
				pleasure, succor and victory in the world. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, the believers have been exhorted to the
				effect that just as the disciples of the Prophet Jesus
				had helped him in the cause of Allah, so should they also
				become "helpers of Allah", so that they too are blessed
				with the same kind of good pleasure and approval of Allah
				as had been the believers before them against the
				disbelievers. 
			</p>
		</section>
	</sura>
	<sura num="62">
		<section heading="Name">
			<p>
				It is derived from the sentence idha nudiya-lis-salat-i
				min-yaum-il-Jumu'ati of verse 9. Although in this Surah
				injunctions about the Friday congregational Prayer also
				have been given, yet "Jumu'ah" is not the title of its
				subject-matter as a whole, but this name too, like the
				names of other Surahs, is only a symbolic title. 
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				The period of the revelation of the first section (vv.
				1-8) is A.H. 7, and probably it was sent down on the
				occasion of the conquest of Khaiber or soon after it.
				Bukhari, Muslim, Tirmidhi, Nasa'i and Ibn Jarir have
				related on the authority of Hadrat Abu Hurairah that he
				and other Companions were sitting in the Holy Prophet's
				assembly when these verses were revealed. About Abu
				Hurairah it is confirmed historically that he entered
				Islam after the truce of Hudaibiyah and before the
				conquest of Khaiber, and Khaiber was conquered, according
				to Ibn Hisham, in Muharram, and, according to Ibn Sa'd,
				in Jamadi al-Awwal, A.H. 7. Thus presumably Allah might
				have sent down these verses, addressing the Jews, when
				their last stronghold had fallen to the Muslims, or these
				might have been revealed when, seeing the fate of
				Khaiber, all the Jewish settlements of northern Hijaz had
				surrendered to the Islamic government. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The second section (vv. 9-11) was sent down shortly after
				the emigration, for the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
				Allah's peace) had established the Friday congregational
				Prayer on the 5th day after his arrival at Madinah. The
				incident that has been referred to in the last verse of
				this section must have occurred at a time when the people
				had not yet received full training in the etiquette of
				religious congregations. 
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				As we have explained above, the two sections of this
				Surah were sent down in two different periods. That is
				why their themes as well as their audiences are
				different. Although there is a kind of harmony between
				them on account of which they have been put together in
				one Surah, yet we should understand their themes
				separately before we consider the question of their
				harmony.  
			</p>
			<p>
				The first section was sent down at a time when all Jewish
				efforts to obstruct the message of Islam during the past
				six years had failed. First, in Madinah as many as three
				of their powerful tribes had done whatever they could to
				frustrate the mission of the Holy Prophet, with the
				result that one of the tribes was completely exterminated
				and the other two were exiled. Then by intrigue and
				conspiracy they brought many of the Arab tribes together
				to advance on Madinah, but in the Battle of the Trench
				they were all repulsed. After this, Khaiber had become
				their stronghold, where a large number of the Jews
				expelled from Madinah also had taken refuge. At the time
				these verses were revealed, that too was taken without
				any extraordinary effort, and the Jews at their own
				request agreed to live there as tenants of the Muslims.
				After this final defeat the Jewish power in Arabia came
				to an end. Then, Wad-il-Qura, Fadak Taima', Tabuk, all
				surrendered one after the other, so much so that all
				Arabian Jews became subdued to the same Islam which they
				were not prepared to tolerate before. This was the
				occasion when Allah Almighty once again addressed them in
				this Surah, and probably this was the last and final
				address that was directed to them in the Quran. In this
				they have been reminded of three things:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					"You refused to believe in this Messenger only
					because he was born among a people whom you
					contemptuously call the "gentiles". You were
					under the false delusion that the Messenger must
					necessarily belong to your own community. You
					seemed to have been convinced that anyone who
					claimed to be a prophet from outside your
					community, must be an impostor for this office
					had been reserved for your race, and a messenger
					could never be raised among the "gentiles". But
					among the same gentiles Allah has raised a
					Messenger who is reciting His Book in front of
					your very eyes, is purifying souls, and showing
					the Right Way to the people whose misdeeds are
					well known to you . This is Allah's bounty, which
					He may bestow on anyone He may please. You have
					no monopoly over it so that He may bestow it over
					whomever you may please and may withhold it from
					whomever you may desire it to be withheld."
				</li>
				<li>
					"You had been made bearers of the Torah, but you
					did not understand your responsibility for it nor
					discharged it as you should have. You are like
					the donkey which is loaded with books, and which
					does not know what burden it is bearing. Rather
					you are worse than the donkey, for the donkey is
					devoid of sense, but you are intelligent. You not
					only shirk your responsibility of being bearers
					of Allah's book, but you do not even hesitate to
					deny Allah's revelations deliberately. Yet, you
					are under the delusion that you are Allah's
					favourites and the blessing of apostleship has
					been reserved for you alone. More than that, you
					seem to entertain the notion that whether you
					fulfill the demands of Allah's message or not,
					Allah in any case is bound not to make any other
					than you the bearer of His message." 
				</li>
				<li>
					"If you really were Allah's favorites and you
					were sure of having a place of honor and high
					rank reserved with Him, you would not have feared

				This is the subject matter of the first section. The
				second section that was sent down many years later, was
				appended to this Surah because in it Allah has bestowed
				Friday on the Muslims as against the Sabbath of the Jews,
				and Allah wanted to warn the Muslims not to treat their
				Friday as the Jews had treated their Sabbath. This
				section was sent down on an occasion when a trade caravan
				arrived in Madinah right at the time of the Friday
				congregational service and hearing its din and drum the
				audience, except for 12 men, left the Prophet's Mosque
				and rushed out to the caravan, although the Holy Prophet
				(upon whom be Allah's peace) at that time was delivering
				the Sermon. Thereupon it was enjoined that after the call
				is sounded for the Friday Prayer all trade and business
				and other occupations become forbidden. The believers
				should then suspend every kind of transaction and hasten
				to the remembrance of Allah. However, when the Prayer is
				over, they have the right to disperse in the land to
				resume their normal occupations. This section could be
				made an independent Surah in view of the commandments
				that it contains about the congregational service on
				Friday, and could also be included in some other Surah,
				but, instead, it has been included here particularly in
				the verses in which the Jews have been warned of the
				causes of their evil end. Its wisdom in our opinion is
				the same as we have explained above.

				As we shall explain below this Surah was sent down either
				during the Holy Prophet's return journey from his
				campaign against Bani al-Mustaliq, or immediately after
				his arrival back at Madinah, and we have established by
				argument and research in the Introduction to Surah An-Nur
				that the campaign against Bani al-Mustaliq had taken

				revelation of this Surah is determined precisely.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Historical Background">
			<p>
				Before we mention the particular incident about which
				this Surah was sent down, it is necessary to have a look
				at the history of the hypocrites of Madinah, for the
				incident that occurred on this occasion was not a chance
				happening but had a whole series of events behind it,
				which ultimately led up to it. Before the Holy Prophet's
				emigration to Madinah the tribes of the Aus and the
				Khazraj, fed up with their mutual rivalries and civil
				wars, had almost agreed on the leadership of one man and
				were making preparations to crown him their king. This
				was Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul, the chief of the
				Khazraj. Muhammad bin Ishaq has stated that among the
				people of Khazraj his authority was never contested and
				never had the Aus and the Khazraj rallied to one man
				before this.
			</p>
			<p>
				Such were the conditions when the voice of Islam reached
				Madinah and the influential people of both the tribes
				started becoming Muslims. When before the Emigration,
				invitation was being extended to the Holy Prophet (upon
				whom be Allah's peace) to come to Madinah, Hadrat Abbas
				bin Ubadah bin Nadlah Ansari wanted to defer this
				invitation for the reason that Abdullah bin Ubayy also
				might join in the declaration of allegiance and
				invitation to the Holy Prophet, so that Madinah might
				become the center of Islam by common consent. But the
				delegation that arrived in Makkah to declare their
				allegiance did not give any importance to the proposal of
				Abbas bin Ubadah, and a11 its members, who included 75
				men from both the tribes, became ready to invite the Holy
				Prophet in the face of every danger (Ibn Hisham, vol. II,
				p. 89). We have given the details of this event in the
				Introduction to Surah Al-Anfal.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, when the Holy Prophet arrived in Madinah, Islam had
				so deeply penetrated every house of the Ansar that
				Abdullah bin Ubayy became helpless and did not see any
				other way to save his leadership than to become a Muslim
				himself. So, he entered Islam along with many of his
				followers from among the chiefs and leaders of both the
				tribes although their hearts were burning with rage from
				within. Ibn Ubayy in particular was filled with grief,
				for the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) had
				deprived him of his kingship. For several years his
				hypocritical faith and grief of being deprived of his
				kingdom manifested itself in different ways. On the one
				hand, when on Fridays the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
				Allah's peace) took his seat to deliver the Sermon,
				Abdullah bin Ubayy would stand up and say "O people, the
				Messenger of Allah is present among you, by whom Allah
				has honored you; therefore, you should support him and
				listen to what he says and obey him." (Ibn Hisham, vol.
				III, p. 111). On the other, his hypocrisy was being
				exposed day by day and the true Muslims were realizing
				that he and his followers bore great malice against
				Islam, the Holy Prophet and the Muslims.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once when the Holy Prophet was passing on the way
				Abdullah bin Ubayy spoke to him in harsh words. When the
				Holy Prophet complained of it to Hadrat Sa'd bin Ubadah;
				he said: "O Messenger of Allah, don't be hard on him, for
				when Allah sent you to us we were making a diadem to
				crown him, and, by God, he thinks that you have robbed
				him of his kingdom." (Ibn Hisham vol: II, pp. 237-238).
				After the Battle of Badr when the Holy Prophet (upon whom
				be Allah's peace) invaded the Jewish tribe of Bani
				Qainuqa on their breaking the agreement and unprovoked
				revolt, this man stood up in support of them, and holding
				the Holy Prophet by his armor, said: "These 700 fighters
				have been helping and protecting me against every enemy;
				would you cut them down in one morning? By God, I will
				not leave you until you pardon my clients." (Ibn Hisham,
				vol. III, pp. 5l-52).
			</p>
			<p>
				On the occasion of the Battle of Uhud this man committed
				open treachery and withdrew from the battlefield with 300
				of his companions. One should note that at this critical
				moment when he so acted, the Quraish had marched upon
				Madinah with 3,000 troops and the Holy Prophet had
				marched out with only 1,000 men to resist them. Of these
				1,000 this hypocrite broke away with 300 men and the Holy
				Prophet was left with only 700 men to meet 3,000 troops
				of the enemy in the field.
			</p>
			<p>
				After this incident the common Muslims of Madinah came to
				realize fully that he was certainly a hypocrite and those
				Companions also were found who were his associates in
				hypocrisy. That is why when on the very first Friday,
				after the Battle of Uhud, this man stood up as usual to
				make a speech before the Holy Prophet's Sermon, the
				people pulled at his garment, saying "Sit down you are
				not worthy to say such things." That was the first
				occasion in Madinah when this man was publicly disgraced.
				Thereupon he was so filled with rage that he left the
				mosque jumping over the heads of the people. At the door
				of the Mosque some of the Ansar said to him, "What are
				you doing? Go back and ask the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
				Allah's peace) to pray for your forgiveness." He retorted
				"I do not want him to pray for my forgiveness." (Ibn
				Hisham, vol. III, p. 111).
			</p>
			<p>
				Then in A.H. 4 the Battle of Bani an-Nadir took place. On
				this occasion he and his companions supported the enemies
				of Islam even more openly. On the one side, the Holy
				Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) and his devoted
				Companions were preparing for war against their enemy,
				the Jews, and on the other, these hypocrites were
				secretly sending messages to the Jews to the effect:
				"Stand firm we are with you: if you are attacked, we will
				help you, and if you are driven out, we too will go out
				with you." The secret of this intrigue was exposed by
				Allah Himself, as has been explained in Surah Al-Hashr:
				11-17 above.
			</p>
			<p>
				But in spite of being so exposed the reason why the Holy
				Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) was still treating
				him kindly was that he had a large band of the hypocrites
				behind him. Many of the chiefs of both the Aus and the
				Khazraj were his supporters. At least a third of the
				population of Madinah consisted of his companions, as
				became manifest on the occasion of the Battle of Uhud.
				Under such conditions it was not prudent to wage a war
				with these internal enemies combined with the external
				enemies. On this very account, in spite of being fully
				aware of their hypocrisy the Holy Prophet continued to
				deal with them according to their apparent profession of
				faith for a long time. On the other hand, these people
				too neither possessed the power nor the courage to fight
				the believers openly as disbelievers, or to join hands
				with an invader and face them in the battlefield.
				Apparently they were a strong hand but inwardly they had
				the weakness which Allah has vividly portrayed in Surah
				Al-Hashr: 12-14. Therefore; they thought their wellbeing
				lay only in posing as Muslims. They came to the mosque,
				offered the prayers, gave away the zakat, and would make
				tall oral claims to the faith, which the true Muslims
				never felt the need to do. They would offer a thousand
				justifications for each of their hypocritical acts by
				which they would try to deceive their compatriots, the
				Ansar, into believing that they were with them. By these
				designs they were not only saving themselves from the
				disadvantages which could naturally accrue if they
				separated themselves from the Ansar brotherhood, but also
				taking advantage of the opportunities to make mischief
				which were available to them as members of the Muslim
				brotherhood.
			</p>
			<p>
				These were the causes which enabled Abdullah bin Ubayy
				and like minded hypocrites to get an opportunity to
				accompany the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace)
				in his campaign against the Bani al-Mustaliq, and they
				simultaneously engineered two great mischiefs which could
				shatter the Muslim unity to pieces. However, by virtue of
				the wonderful training in discipline that the Muslims had
				received through the pure teaching of the Quran and the
				companionship of the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
				both mischiefs were stopped in time, and the hypocrites
				themselves were disgraced instead. One of these was the
				mischief that has been mentioned in Surah An-Nur above,
				and the other which has been mentioned in this Surah.
			</p>
			<p>
				This incident has been related by Bukhari, Muslim, Ahmad,
				Nasai, Tirmidhi, Baihaqi, Tabari, Ibn Marduyah, Abdur
				Razzaq, Ibn Jarir Tabari, Ibn Sa'd and Muhammad bin Ishaq
				through many reliable channels. In some traditions the
				expedition in which it took place has not been named, and
				in others it has been connected with the Battle of Tabuk.
				But the authorities on the battles fought by the Holy
				Prophet and history are agreed that this incident took
				place on the occasion of the campaign against the Bani
				al-Mustaliq. The following seems to he the real story
				when all the traditions are read together.
			</p>
			<p>
				When after crushing down the power of Bani al-Mustaliq
				the Islamic army had made a halt in the settlement at the
				well of al Muraisi. Suddenly a dispute arose between two
				men on taking water from the well; One of them was Jehjah
				bin Masud Ghifari, a servant of Hadrat Umar appointed to
				lead his horse. The other was Sinan bin Wabar al-Juhani,
				whose tribe was an ally of a clan of the Khazraj. Harsh
				words between them led to fighting and Jehjah kicked
				Sinan, which the Ansar, on account of their ancient
				Yamanite tradition, took as a great insult and disgrace.
				At this Sinan called out the men of Ansar and Jehjah the
				Emigrants for help. Hearing about the quarrel Ibn Ubayy
				started inciting and calling the men of the Aus and the
				Khazraj to come out and help their ally. From the other
				side some Emigrants also came out. The dispute might have
				led to a fight between the Ansar and the Muhajirin
				themselves at the very place where they had just fought
				an enemy tribe jointly and crushing it had halted in its
				own territory. But hearing the noise the Holy Prophet
				(upon whom be peace) emerged and said: "What is this call
				of paganism? What have you to do with such a call? Leave
				it: it is a dirty thing." Thereupon the leading men of
				the two sides met and settled the dispute; Sinan pardoned
				Jehjah and peace was restored.
			</p>
			<p>
				After this every person whose heart was disaffected came
				to Abdullah hin Ubayy and they all said to him, "Until
				now we had our hopes attached to you and you were
				protecting us, but now it seems you have become a helper
				of these paupers against us." Ibn Ubayy was already
				enraged: These words made him burst out, thus: "This is
				what you have done to yourselves. You have given these
				people shelter in your country, and have divided your
				property among them. So much so that they have now become
				our rivals. Nothing so fits us and the paupers of Quraish
				(or the Companions of Muhammad) as the ancient saying
				'Feed your dog to fatten it and it will devour you.' If
				you hold back your property from them, they would go
				elsewhere. By God, when we return to Madinah, the
				honorable ones will drive out from it the mean ones."
			</p>
			<p>
				Zaid bin Arqam, a young boy, also happened to be present
				in the assembly at that time. He heard this and mentioned
				it before his uncle, and his uncle who was one of the
				Ansar chiefs went to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
				peace) and told him the whole story. The Holy Prophet
				called Zaid and asked him what had happened and he
				repeated every word of what he had heard. The Holy
				Prophet said, "Zaid, you are perhaps displeased with Ibn
				Ubayy; you might have been mistaken in hearing; you might
				have imagined Ibn Ubayy said this." But Zaid was sure and
				firm. He said, "No, I swear by God I have heard him say
				this and that." Thereupon the Holy Prophet called Ibn
				Ubayy, and he came and swore that he had not said any
				such thing. The people of the Ansar also said "Sir, a boy
				says this: he might have been mistaken in what he heard.
				Ibn Ubayy is a venerable old man and our chief. Do not
				believe what a boy says against him." The elderly people
				of the tribe reproved Zaid also, who became depressed and
				held his peace. But the Holy Prophet knew Zaid as well as
				Abdullah bin Ubayy. Therefore, he fully understood what
				had actually happened.
			</p>
			<p>
				When Hadrat Umar came to know of this, he came to the
				Holy Prophet and said: "Please allow me to put this
				hypocrite to the sword. Or, if you do not think it is fit
				to give me the permission you may tell Muadh bin Jabal,
				or Abbad bin Bishr, or Sad bin Mu'adh, or Muhammad bin
				Maslamah from among the Ansar, to go and kill him." But
				the Holy Prophet said: "No, the people will say Muhammad
				kills his own Companions." After this he ordered the
				people to set off immediately, although it was at a time
				when the Holy Prophet was not accustomed to travel. The
				forced march continued for 30 hours at a stretch so that
				the people became exhausted. Then he halted, and as soon
				as they touched the ground they fell asleep. This he did
				to distract their minds from what had happened at the
				well of al-Muraisi. On the way, Hadrat Usaid bin Hudair,
				an Ansar chief, met the Holy Prophet, and said: "O
				Messenger of Allah, today you ordered the people to set
				off at a time which was disagreeable for traveling, a
				thing you have never done before." The Holy Prophet
				replied: "Have you. not heard of what your friend said?"
				When he asked who he meant, the Holy Prophet
				replied:Abdullah bin Ubayy. He asked what he had said.
				The Holy Prophet answered: "He has asserted that when he
				returns to Madinah the honorable ones will drive out from
				it the mean ones. He answered: "By God, O Messenger of
				Allah, you are the honorable one and he is the mean one;
				you will drive him out whenever you want to."
			</p>
			<p>
				By and by the news spread among the Ansar soldiers and it
				enraged them against Ibn Ubayy. The people advised him to
				go to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) and
				request for his forgiveness, but he retorted : "You asked
				me to believe in him, and I believed in him; you asked me
				to pay the zakat on my property, and I paid the zakat
				too; now the only thing left is that I should bow down to
				Muhammad." This further enraged the believing Ansar and
				everyone started reproaching and cursing him roughly.
				When the caravan was about to enter Madinah, Abullah, the
				son of Abdullah bin Ubayy, stood before his father with a
				drawn out sword, and said: "You had said that when you
				reached Madinah, the honorable ones would drive out the
				mean ones. Now, you will know who is honorable, you or
				Allah and His Messenger. By God, you cannot enter Madinah
				until the Messenger of Allah (upon whom be Allah's peace)
				permits you to enter." At this Ibn Uhayy cried out: "O
				people of Khazraj, look, my own son is preventing me from
				entering Madinah." The people conveyed this news to the
				Holy Prophet, and he said : "Tell Abdullah to let his
				father come home." Abdullah said, "If this is the Holy
				Prophet's order, then you may enter." Thereupon the Holy
				Prophet said to Hadrat Umar: "Now what do you think,
				Umar? Had you killed him on the day when you asked my
				permission to kill him, many people woujd have trembled
				with rage. Today if I order them to kill him, they will
				kill him immediately." Hadrat Umar replied, "By God, I
				realize there was greater wisdom behind what the Apostle
				of Allah said than what I said." These were the
				circumstances under which this Surah was sent down most
				probably after the Holy Prophet's return to Madinah.

		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				Muqatil and Kalbi say that it was partly revealed at
				Makkah and partly at Madinah. Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas
				and Ata bin Yasar say that vv. 1-13 were revealed at
				Makkah and vv. 14-18 at Madinah. But the majority of
				commentators regard the whole of the surah as a Madinan
				Revelation. Although there is no internal evidence to
				help determine its exact period of revelation, yet a
				study of its subject matter shows that it might probably
				have been sent down at an early stage at Madinah. That is
				why it partly resembles the Makkah surahs and partly the
				Madinan Surahs.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				The theme of this surah is invitation to the Faith and
				obedience (to Allah) and the teaching of good morals. The
				sequence followed is that the first four verses are
				addressed to all men; verses 5-10 to those men who do not
				believe in the invitation of the Quran; and verses 11-18
				to those who accept and believe in this invitation. In
				the verses addressed to all men, they have been made
				aware in a few brief sentences of the four fundamental
				truths:
			</p>
			<p>
				First, that the universe in which they live is not
				Godless, but its Creator, Master and Ruler is an All
				Powerful God, and everything in it testifies to His being
				most Perfect and absolutely faultless.
			</p>
			<p>
				Second, that the universe is not without purpose and
				wisdom, but its Creator has created it with truth; no one
				should be under the delusion that it is a mock show,
				which began without a purpose and will come to an end
				without a purpose.
			</p>
			<p>
				Third, that the excellent form that God has created you
				with and the choice that He has given you to choose
				between belief and unbelief is not a useless and
				meaningless activity so that it may be of no consequence
				whether you choose belief or unbelief. In fact, God is
				watching as to how you exercise your choice.
			</p>
			<p>
				Fourth, that you have not been created irresponsible and
				unanswerable. You have to return ultimately to your
				Creator, and have to meet the Being who is aware of
				everything in the universe, from Whom nothing is hidden,
				to Whom even the innermost thoughts of the minds are
				known.
			</p>
			<p>
				After stating these four fundamental truths about the
				Universe and Man, the address turns to the people who
				adopted the way of unbelief, and their attention is drawn
				to a phenomenon which has persisted throughout human
				history, namely that nation after nation has arisen and
				ultimately gone to its doom. Man by his intellect and
				reason has been explaining this phenomenon in a thousand
				ways, but Allah tells the real truth and declares that
				the fundamental causes of the destruction of the nations
				were only two.
			</p>
			<p>
				First, that they refused to believe in the Messengers
				whom He sent for their guidance, with the result that
				Allah too left them to themselves, and they invented
				their own philosophies of life and went on groping their
				way from one error to another.
			</p>
			<p>
				Second, that they also rejected the doctrine of
				Hereafter, and thought this worldly life to be an end in
				itself, and that there was no life hereafter when they
				would have to render an account of their deeds before
				God. This corrupted their whole attitude towards life,
				and their impure morals and character so polluted the
				world that eventually the scourge of God itself had to
				descend and eliminate them from the scene.
			</p>
			<p>
				After stating these two instructive truths of human
				history, the deniers of the message of Truth have been
				admonished to wake up and believe in Allah, His Messenger
				and the Light of Guidance that Allah has sent in the form
				of the Quran if they want to avoid the fate met by the
				former peoples. Besides, they have been warned that the
				Day shall eventually come when all the former and the
				latter generations will be collected at one place and the
				fraud and embezzlement committed by each will be exposed
				before all mankind. Then the fate of each man will be
				decided finally on the basis as to who had adopted the
				path of the Faith and righteousness and who had followed
				the way of disbelief and denial of the Truth. The first
				group shall deserve eternal Paradise and the second shall
				be doomed to everlasting Hell. Then, addressing those who
				adopt the way of the Faith, a few important instructions
				have been given:
			</p>
			<p>
				First, that whatever affliction befalls a person in the
				world, it befalls him by Allah's leave. Whoever in this
				state of affliction remains steadfast to the Faith, Allah
				blesses his heart with guidance; otherwise although the
				affliction of the one who in confusion or bewilderment
				turns away from the path of the Faith, cannot be averted
				except by Allah's leave, yet he becomes involved in
				another, the greatest affliction of all, namely that his
				heart is deprived of the guidance of Allah.
			</p>
			<p>
				Secondly, that the believer is not required to affirm the
				faith with the tongue only, but after the affirmation of
				the Faith he should practically obey Allah and His
				Messenger. If he turns away from obedience he would
				himself be responsible for his loss, for the Holy
				Messenger of Allah (upon whom be His peace) has become
				absolved from the responsibility after having delivered
				the message of Truth.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thirdly, that the believer should place his trust in
				Allah alone and not in his own power or some other power
				of the world.
			</p>
			<p>
				Fourthly, that the worldly goods and children are a great
				trial and temptation for the believer, for it is their
				love which generally distracts man from the path of faith
				and obedience. Therefore, the believers have to beware
				some of their children, and wives lest they become
				robbers for them on the Way of God directly or
				indirectly; and they should spend their wealth for the
				sake of God so that their self remains safe against the
				temptations of Satan.
			</p>
			<p>
				Fifthly, that every man is responsible only to the extent
				of his power and ability. Allah does not demand that man
				should exert himself beyond his power and ability.
				However, the believer should try his best to live in fear
				of God as far as possible, and should see that he does
				not transgress the bounds set by Allah in his speech,
				conduct and dealings through his own negligence.

				"And if those of you who die, leave wives behind, the
				women should abstain (from marriage) for four months and
				ten days." (Al-Baqarah 234)
			</p>
			<p>
				The rules prescribed in these verses were as follows: 
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					A man can pronounce at the most three divorces on
					his wife.
				</li>
				<li>
					In case the husband has pronounced one or two
					divorces he is entitled to keep the woman back as
					wife within the waiting period and if after the
					expiry of the waiting period the two desire to
					re-marry, they can re-marry; there is no
					condition of legalization (tahlil). But if the
					husband has pronounced three divorces, he
					forfeits his right to keep her as his wife within
					the waiting period, and they cannot re-marry
					unless the woman remarries another husband and he
					subsequently divorces her of his own free will.
				</li>
				<li>
					The waiting period of the woman, who menstruates
					and marriage with whom has been consummated, is
					that she should pass three monthly courses. The
					waiting period in case of one or two divorces is
					that the woman is still the legal wife of the
					husband and he can keep her back as his wife
					within the waiting period. But if the husband has
					pronounced three divorces, this waiting period
					cannot be taken advantage of for the purpose of
					reconciliation, but it is only meant to restrain
					the woman from re-marrying another person before
					it comes to an end.
				</li>
				<li>
					There is no waiting period for the woman,
					marriage with whom has not been consummated, and
					who is divorced even before she is touched. She
					can re-marry, if she likes, immediately after the
					divorce.
				</li>
				<li>
					The waiting period of the woman whose husband
					dies, is four months and ten days.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Here, one should understand well that Surah At-Talaq was
				not sent down to annul any of these rules or amend it,
				but it was sent down for two purposes: first, that the
				man who has been given the right to pronounce divorce
				should be taught such judicious methods of using this
				right as do not lead to separation, as far as possible
				however, if separation does take place, it should only be
				in case all possibilities of mutual reconciliation have
				been exhausted. For in the Divine Law provision for
				divorce has been made only as an unavoidable necessity;
				otherwise Allah does not approve that the marriage
				relationship that has been established between a man and
				a woman should ever break. The Holy Prophet (upon whom be
				Allah's peace) has said "Allah has not made lawful
				anything more hateful in His sight than divorce." (Abu
				Daud). And: "Of all the things permitted by the Law, the
				most hateful in the sight of Allah is the divorce." (Abu
				Daud).
			</p>
			<p>
				The second object was to complement this section of the
				family law of Islam by supplying answers to the questions
				that had remained after the revelation of the
				commandments in Surah Al-Baqarah. So, answers have been
				supplied to the following questions: What would be the
				waiting period of the women, marriage with whom has been
				consummated and who no longer menstruate, or those who
				have not yet menstruated, in case they are divorced? What
				would be the waiting period of the woman, who is
				pregnant, or the woman whose husband dies, if she is
				divorced?And what arrangements would be made for the
				maintenance and lodging of the different categories of
				divorced women, and for the fosterage of the child whose
				parents have separated on account of a divorce?

		<section heading="Name">
			<p>
				The Surah derived its name from the words lima tuharrimu
				of the very first verse. This too is not a title of its
				subject matter, but the name implies that it is the Surah
				in which the incident of tahrim (prohibition,
				forbiddance) has been mentioned.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				In connection with the incident of tahrim referred to in
				this Surah, the traditions of the Hadith mention two
				ladies who were among the wives of the Holy Prophet (upon
				whom be peace) at that time: Hadrat Safiyyah and Hadrat
				Mariyah Qibtiyyah. The former (i.e. Hadrat Safiyyah) was
				taken to wife by the Holy Prophet after the conquest of
				Khaiber, and Khaiber was conquered, as has been
				unanimously reported, in A.H. 7. The other lady, Hadrat
				Mariyah, had been presented to the Holy Prophet by
				Muqawqis, the ruler of Egypt, in A. H. 7 and she had
				borne him his son, Ibrahim, in Dhil-Hijjah, A.H. 8.These
				historical events almost precisely determine that this
				Surah was sent down some time during A.H. 7 or A.H 8.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Topics">
			<p>
				This is a very important Surah in which light has been
				thrown on some questions of grave significance with
				reference to some incidents concerning the wives of the
				Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace). First, that
				the powers to prescribe the bounds of the lawful and the
				unlawful, the permissible and the forbidden, are entirely
				and absolutely in the hand of Allah and nothing has been
				delegated even to the Prophet of Allah himself, not to
				speak of any other man. The Prophet as such can declare
				something lawful or unlawful only if he receives an
				inspiration from Allah to do so whether that inspiration
				is embodied in the Quran, or imparted to him secretly.
				However, even the Prophet is not authorized to declare
				anything made permissible by Allah unlawful by himself,
				much less to say of another man.
			</p>
			<p>
				Second, that in any society the position of a Prophet is
				very delicate. A minor incident experienced by an
				ordinary man in his life may not be of any consequence,
				but it assumes the status of law when experienced by a
				Prophet. That is why the lives of the Prophets have been
				kept under close supervision by Allah so that none of
				their acts, not even a most trivial one, may deviate from
				Divine Will. Whenever such an act has emanated from a
				Prophet, it was rectified and rectified immediately so
				that the Islamic law and its principles should reach the
				people in their absolute purity not only through the
				Divine Book but also through the excellent example of the
				Prophet, and they should include nothing which may be in
				disagreement with Divine Will.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thirdly, and this automatically follows from the above
				mentioned point, that when the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
				peace) was checked on a minor thing, which was not only
				corrected but also recorded, it gives us complete
				satisfaction that whatever actions and commands and
				instructions we now find in the pure life of the Holy
				Prophet concerning which there is nothing on record in
				the nature of criticism or correction from Allah, they
				are wholly based on truth, are in complete conformity
				with Divine Will and we can draw guidance from them with
				full confidence and peace of mind.
			</p>
			<p>
				The fourth thing that we learn from this discourse is
				that about the Holy Messenger himself, whose reverence
				and respect Allah Himself has enjoined as a necessary
				part of the Faith of His servants, it has been stated in
				this Surah that once during his sacred life he made a
				thing declared lawful by Allah unlawful for himself only
				to please his wives; then Allah has severely reproved for
				their errors those very wives of the Holy Prophet, whom
				He Himself has declared as mothers of the faithful and
				worthy of the highest esteem and honor by them. Then,
				this criticism of the Prophet and the administration of
				the warning to the wives also has not been made secretly
				but included in the Book, which the entire umrah has to
				read and recite for ever. Obviously, neither the
				intention of making mention of it in the Book of Allah
				was, nor it could be, that Allah wanted to degrade His
				Messenger and the mothers of the faithful in the eyes of
				the believers; and this also is obvious that no Muslim
				has lost respect for them, in his heart after reading
				this Surah of the Quran. Now, there cannot be any other
				reason of mentioning this thing in the Quran than that
				Allah wants to acquaint the believers with the correct
				manner of reverence for their great personalities. The
				Prophet is a Prophet, not God, that he may commit no
				error. Respect of the Prophet has not been enjoined
				because he is infallible, but because he is a perfect
				representative of Divine Will, and Allah has not
				permitted any of his errors to pass by unnoticed. This
				gives us the satisfaction that the noble pattern of life
				left by the Prophet wholly and fully represents the will
				of Allah. Likewise, the Companions of the holy wives of
				the Prophet, were human, not angels or supermen. They
				could commit mistakes. Whatever ranks they achieved
				became possible only because the guidance given by Allah
				and the training imparted by Allah's Messenger had molded
				them into the finest models. Whatever esteem and
				reverence they deserve is on this very basis and not on
				the presumption that they were infallible. For this
				reason, whenever in the sacred lifetime of the Prophet
				(upon him be peace) the Companions or holy wives happened
				to commit an error due to human weakness, they were
				checked. Some of their errors were corrected by the Holy
				Prophet, as has been mentioned at many places in the
				Hadith; some other errors were mentioned in the Quran and
				Allah Himself corrected them so that the Muslims might
				not form any exaggerated notion of the respect and
				reverence of their elders and great men, which might
				raise them from humanity to the position of gods and
				goddesses. If one studies the Quran carefully, one will
				see instances of this one after the other. In Surah
				Al-Imran, in connection with the Battle of Uhud, the
				Companions have been addressed and told:
			</p>
			<p>
				"Allah did fulfill His promise (of help) to you: in the
				initial stage of the battle, it was you who were killing
				them by Allah's leave until you lost heart and disputed
				about your duty and disobeyed your leader, when Allah
				showed you what (the spoils) you coveted for there were
				among you some who hankered after the life of this world,
				and others who cherished the life after death. Then Allah
				caused your retreat before the disbelievers in order to
				test you, but the fact is that even then Allah pardoned
				you, for Allah is very gracious to the believers." (v.
				152).
			</p>
			<p>
				In surah An-Nur, in connection with the Slander against
				Hadrat Aisha, the Companions were told, "When you heard
				of it, why did not the believing men and the believing
				women have a good opinion of themselves, and why did they
				not say: this is a manifest slander?...Were it not for
				Allah's grace and mercy towards you in this world and in
				the Hereafter, a painful scourge would have visited you
				because of the slander. (Just consider) when you passed
				this lie on from one tongue to the other and uttered with
				your mouths that of which you had no knowledge. You took
				it as a trifling matter whereas it was a grave offence in
				the sight of Allah. Why did you not, as soon as you heard
				of it, say 'It is not proper for us to utter such a
				thing? Glory be to Allah! This is a great slander'."Allah
				admonishes you that in future you should never repeat
				anything like this, if you are true believers." (vv.
				12-I7).
			</p>
			<p>
				In surah Al-Ahzab, the holy wives have been addressed
				thus: "O Prophet, say to your wives: If you seek the
				world and its adornments, come, I shall give you of these
				and send you off in a good way. But if you seek Allah and
				His Messenger and the abode of the Hereafter, you should
				rest assured that Allah has prepared a great reward for
				those of you, who do good." (vv. 28-29).
			</p>
			<p>
				In Surah Jumu'ah about the Companions it was said: "And
				when they saw some merchandise and amusement they broke
				off to it and left you (O Prophet) standing (in the
				course of the Sermon). Say to them : that which is with
				Allah is far better than amusement and merchandise, and
				Allah is the best of all providers." (v. 11).
			</p>
			<p>
				In Surah Al-Mumtahinah, Hadrat Hatib bin Abi Balta'ah, a
				Companion who had fought at Badr, was severely taken to
				task because he had sent secret information to the
				disbelieving Quraish about the Holy Prophet's invasion
				before the conquest of Makkah.
			</p>
			<p>
				All these instances are found in the Quran itself, in the
				same Quran in which Allah Himself has paid tribute to the
				Companions and the holy wives for their great merits, and
				granted them the certificate of His good pleasure,
				saying: "Allah became well pleased with them and they
				with Allah." It was this same moderate and balanced
				teaching of the reverence and esteem of the great men,
				which saved the Muslims from falling into the pit of man
				worship in which the Jews and the Christians fell, and it
				is a result of the same that in the books that the
				eminent followers of the sunnah have compiled on the
				subjects of the Hadith, Commentary of the Quran and
				History, not only have the excellence and great merits of
				the Companions and holy wives and other illustrious men
				been mentioned, but also no hesitancies has been shown in
				mentioning the incidents relating to their weaknesses,
				errors and mistakes, whereas those scholars were more
				appreciative of the merits and excellencies of the great
				men and understood the bounds and limits of reverence
				better than those who claim to be the upholders of
				reverence for the elders today.
			</p>
			<p>
				The fifth thing that has been explicitly mentioned in
				this Surah is that Allah's Religion is absolutely fair
				and just. It has for every person just that of which he
				becomes worthy on the basis of his faith and works. No
				relationship or connection even with the most righteous
				person can be beneficial for him in any way and no
				relationship or connection with the most evil and wicked
				person can be harmful for him in any way. In this
				connection three kinds of women have been cited as
				examples before the holy wives in particular. One example
				is of the wives of the Prophets Noah and Lot, who, if
				they had believed and cooperated with their illustrious
				husbands, would have occupied the same rank and position
				in the Muslim community which is enjoyed by the wives of
				the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and
				blessings). But since they were disbelievers, their being
				the wives of the Prophets did not help them and they fell
				into Hell. The second example is of the wife of Pharaoh,
				who in spite of being the wife of a staunch enemy of God
				believed and chose a path of action separate from that
				followed by the Pharaoh's people, and her being the wife
				of a staunch disbeliever did not cause her any harm, and
				Allah made her worthy of Paradise. The third example is
				of Hadrat Maryam (Mary) (peace be upon her), who attained
				to the high rank because she submitted to the severe test
				to which Allah had decided to put her. Apart from Mary no
				other chaste and righteous girl in the world ever has
				been put to such a hard test that in spite of being
				unmarried, she might have been made pregnant miraculously
				by Allah's command and informed what service her Lord
				willed to take from her. When Hadrat Maryam accepted this
				decision, and agreed to bear, like a true believer,
				everything that she inevitably had to bear in order to
				fulfill Allah's will, then did Allah exalt her to the
				noble rank of Sayyidatu an-nisa' fil-Jannah: "Leader of
				the women in Paradise" (Musnad Ahmad).
			</p>
			<p>
				Besides, another truth that we learn from this Surah is
				that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) did not
				receive from Allah only that knowledge which is included
				and recorded in the Quran, but he was given information
				about other things also by revelation, which has not been
				recorded in the Quran. Its clear proof is verse 3 of this
				Surah. In it we are told that the Holy Prophet (upon whom
				be peace) confided a secret to one of his wives, and she
				told it to another. Allah informed the Holy Prophet of
				this secret. Then, when the Holy Prophet warned his
				particular wife on the mistake of disclosure and she
				said: "Who has informed you of this mistake of mine?" he
				replied: "I have been informed of it by Him Who knows
				everything and is All Aware." Now, the question is where
				in the Quran is the verse in which Allah has said "O
				Prophet, the secret that you had confided to one of your
				wives, has been disclosed by her to another person, or to
				so and so?" If there is no such verse in the Quran, and
				obviously there is none, this is an express proof of the
				fact that revelation descended on the Holy Prophet
				besides the Quran as well. This refutes the claim of the
				deniers of Hadith, who allege that nothing was sent down
				to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) apart from the
				Quran.

	<sura num="67">
		<section heading="Name">
			<p>
				The Surah takes its name al-Mulk from the very first
				sentence.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				It could not be known from any authentic tradition when
				this Surah was revealed, but the subject matter and the
				style indicate that it is one of the earliest Surahs to
				be revealed at Makkah.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				In this surah, on the one hand, the teachings of Islam
				have been introduced briefly, and, on the other, the
				people living in heedlessness have been aroused from
				their slumber in a most effective way. A characteristic
				of the earliest surahs of the Makkan period is that they
				present the entire teachings of Islam and the object of
				the Holy Prophet's mission, not in detail, but briefly,
				so that they are assimilated by the people easily.
				Moreover, they are particularly directed to make the
				people shun heedlessness, to make them think, and to
				arouse their dormant conscience.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the first five verses man has been made to realize
				that the universe in which he lives is a most well
				organized and fortified Kingdom in which he cannot detect
				any fault, any weakness or flaw, how ever hard he may try
				to probe. This Kingdom has been brought from nothing into
				existence by Allah Almighty Himself and all the powers of
				controlling, administering and ruling it are also
				entirely in Allah's hand and His power is infinite.
				Besides, man has also been told that in this wise system
				he has not been created without a purpose, but he has
				been sent here for a test and in this test he can succeed
				only by his righteous deeds and conduct.
			</p>
			<p>
				In vv. 6-11, dreadful consequences of disbelief which
				will appear in the Hereafter have been mentioned, and the
				people told that Allah, by sending His Prophets, has
				warned them of these consequences in this very world, as
				if to say "Now, if you do not believe in what the
				Prophets say and correct your attitude and behavior
				accordingly, in the Hereafter you will yourself have to
				admit that you really deserved the punishment that was
				being meted out to you."
			</p>
			<p>
				In vv. 12-14, the truth that has been impressed on the
				minds is that the Creator cannot be unaware of His
				creation, as if to say: "He is aware of each open and
				hidden secret of yours, even of the innermost ideas of
				your hearts. Hence, the right basis of morality is that
				man should avoid evil, fearing the accountability of the
				unseen God, whether in the world there is a power to take
				him to task for this or not, and whether in the world
				there is a possibility of being harmed by such a power or
				not. Those who adopt such a conduct in the world alone
				will deserve forgiveness and a rich reward in the
				Hereafter."
			</p>
			<p>
				In vv. 15-23, making allusions, one after the other to
				those common truths of daily occurrence, which man does
				not regard as worthy of much attention, he has been
				invited to consider them seriously. It has been said:
				"Look: the earth on which you move about with full
				satisfaction and peace of mind, and from which you obtain
				your sustenance has been subdued for you by Allah;
				otherwise this earth might at any time start shaking
				suddenly so as to cause your destruction, or a typhoon
				might occur, which may annihilate you completely. Look at
				the birds that fly above you; it is only Allah Who is
				sustaining them in the air. Look at your own means and
				resources: if Allah wills to inflict you with a scourge,
				none can save you from it; and if Allah wills to close
				the doors of sustenance on you, none can open them for
				you. These things are there to make you aware of the
				truth, but you see them like animals, which are unable to
				draw conclusions from observations, and you do not use
				your sight, hearing and minds which Allah has bestowed on
				you as men; that is why you do not see the right way."
			</p>
			<p>
				In vv. 24-27, it has been said: "You have ultimately to
				appear before your God in any case. It is not for the
				Prophet to tell you the exact time and date of the event.
				His only duty is to warn you beforehand of its inevitable
				occurrence. Today you do not listen to him and demand
				that he should cause the event to occur and appear
				prematurely before you; but when it does occur, and you
				see it with your own eyes, you will then be astounded.
				Then, it will be said to you "This is the very thing you
				were calling to be hastened."
			</p>
			<p>
				In vv. 28-29 replies have been given to what the
				disbelievers of Makkah said against the Holy Prophet
				(upon whom be peace) and his Companions. They cursed the
				Holy Prophet and prayed for his and the believers
				destruction. To this it has been said: "Whether those who
				call you to the right way are destroyed, or shown mercy
				by Allah, how will their fate change your destiny? You
				should look after yourselves and consider who would save
				you if you were overtaken by the scourge of God? You
				regard those who believe in God and put their trust in
				Him as the misguided. A time will come when it will
				become evident as to who was misguided in actual truth.
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, the people have been asked this question
				and left to ponder over it: "If the water which has come
				out from the earth at some place in the desert or hill
				country of Arabia and upon which depends your whole life
				activity, should sink and vanish underground, who beside
				Allah can restore to you this life-giving water?"

			<p>
				This Surah is called Nun as well as Qulum, the words with
				which it begins.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				This too is one of the earliest surahs to be revealed at
				Makkah, but its subject matter shows that it was sent
				down at the time when opposition to the Holy Prophet
				(upon whom be peace) had grown very harsh and tyrannical.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				It consists of three themes: Replies to the opponents
				objections, administration of warning and admonition to
				them, and exhortation to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
				peace) to patience and constancy.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the outset, the Holy Prophet has been addressed, to
				the effect: "The disbelievers call you a madman whereas
				the Book that you are presenting and the sublime conduct
				that you practice, are by themselves sufficient to refute
				their false accusations. Soon they will see as to who was
				mad and who was sane; therefore, do not at all yield to
				the din of opposition being kicked up against you, for
				all this is actually meant to cow you and make you resort
				to a compromise with them."
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, in order to enlighten the common people the
				character of a prominent man from among the opponents,
				whom the people of Makkah fully well recognized, has been
				presented, without naming him: At that time, the Holy
				Prophet's pure and sublime conduct was before them, and
				every discerning eye could also see what sort of
				character and morals were possessed by the chiefs of
				Makkah, who were leading the opposition against him.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, in vv. 17-33, the parable of the owners of a garden
				has been presented, who after having been blessed by
				Allah turned ungrateful to Him, and did not heed the
				admonition of the best man among them when it was given
				them. Consequently, they were deprived of the blessing
				and they realized this, when all they had lay devastated.
				With this parable the people of Makkah have been warned
				to the effect: "With the appointment of the Holy Prophet
				(upon whom be peace) to Prophethood, you, O people of
				Makkah, too, have been put to a test similar to the one
				to which the owners of the garden had been put. If you do
				not listen to him, you too will be afflicted with a
				punishment in the world, and the punishment of the
				Hereafter is far greater."
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, in vv. 34-47 continuously, the disbelievers have
				been admonished, in which the address sometimes turns to
				them directly and sometimes they are warned through the
				Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace). A summary of what has
				been said in this regard, is this: Well being in the
				Hereafter inevitably belongs to those who spend their
				lives in the world in full consciousness of God. It is
				utterly against reason that the obedient servants should
				meet in the Hereafter the same fate as the guilty. There
				is absolutely no basis of the disbelievers
				misunderstanding that God will treat them in the manner
				they choose for themselves, whereas they have no
				guarantee for this. Those who are being called upon to
				bow before God in the world and they refuse to do so,
				would be unable to prostrate themselves on the Day of
				Resurrection even if they wanted to do so, and thus would
				stand disgraced and condemned. Having denied the Quran
				they cannot escape Divine punishment. The rein they are
				being given, has deluded them. They think that since they
				are not being punished in spite of their denial, they
				must be on the right path, whereas they are following the
				path of ruin. They have no reasonable ground for opposing
				the Messenger, for he is a preacher without any vested
				interest: he is not asking any reward of them for
				himself, and they cannot either make the claim that they
				know with certainty that he is not a true Messenger, nor
				that what he says is false.
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) has
				been exhorted to the effect: "Bear with patience the
				hardships that you may have to face in the way of
				preaching the Faith till Allah's judgment arrives, and
				avoid the impatience which caused suffering and
				affliction to the Prophet Jonah (peace be on him)."

				This too is one of the earliest surahs to be revealed at
				Makkah. Its subject matter shows that it was sent down at
				the time when opposition to the Holy Prophet (upon whom
				be peace) had started but had not yet become tyrannical.
				Musnad Ahmad contains a tradition from Hadrat Umar,
				saying: "Before embracing Islam one day I came out of my
				house with a view to causing trouble to the Holy Prophet,
				but he had entered the Masjid al-Haram before me. When I
				arrived I found that he was reciting surah Al-Haaqqah in
				the Prayer. I stood behind him and listened. As he
				recited the Quran I wondered at its literary charm and
				beauty. Then suddenly an idea came to my mind that he
				must be a poet as the Quraish alleged. Just at that
				moment he recited the words: "This is the Word of an
				honorable Messenger: it is not the word of a poet." I
				said to myself: Then, he must be a soothsayer, if not a
				poet. Thereupon be recited the words:"Nor is it the word
				of a soothsayer: little it is that you reflect. It is a
				Revelation from the Lord and Sustainer of the worlds. On
				hearing this Islam entered deep into my heart." This
				tradition of Hadrat Umar shows that this surah had been
				sent down long before his acceptance of Islam, for even
				after this event he did not believe for a long time, and
				he continued to be influenced in favor of Islam by
				different incidents from time to time, till at last in
				the house of his own sister he came by the experience
				that made him surrender and submit to the Faith
				completely. (For details, see introduction to surah
				Maryam and Introduction to surah Al-Waqiah).

				The first section (vv. 1-37) is about the Hereafter and
				the second (vv. 38-52) about the Quran's being a
				revelation from Allah and the Holy Prophet's being a true
				Messenger of Allah. The first section opens with the
				assertion that the coming of the Resurrection and the
				occurrence of the Hereafter is a truth which has to take
				place inevitably. Then in vv. 4-12, it has been stated
				that the communities that denied the Hereafter in the
				past became worthy of Allah's scourge ultimately. In vv.
				13-17 the occurrence of Resurrection has been depicted.
				In vv. 18-37 the real object for which Allah has destined
				a second life for mankind after the present worldly life
				has been enunciated. In it we are told that on that Day
				all men shall appear in the Court of their Lord, where no
				secret of theirs shall remain hidden; each man's record
				will be placed in his hand. Those who had spent lives in
				the world with the realization that one day they would
				have to render an account of their deeds before their
				Lord, and who had worked righteously in the world and
				provided beforehand for their well being in the
				Hereafter, will rejoice when they see that they have been
				acquitted and blessed with the eternal bliss of Paradise.
				On the contrary, those who neither recognized the rights
				of Allah, nor discharged the rights of men, will have no
				one to save them from the punishment of Allah, and they
				will be cast into Hell.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the second section (vv. 38-52) the disbelievers of
				Makkah have been addressed and told: "You think this
				Quran is the word of a poet or soothsayer, whereas it is
				a Revelation sent down by Allah, which is being presented
				by the noble Messengers. The Messenger by himself had no
				power to increase or decrease a word in it. If he forges
				something of his own composition into it, We will cut off
				his neck-vein (or heart-vein). For this is the Truth
				absolute and pure: and those who give it a lie, will have
				ultimately to regret and repent.

		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				The subject matter bears evidence that this Surah too was
				sent down in conditions closely resembling those under
				which Surah Al Haaqqah was sent down.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				It admonishes and gives warning to the disbelievers who
				made fun of the news about Resurrection and the
				Hereafter, and Hell and Heaven, and challenged the Holy
				Prophet (upon whom be peace) to cause Resurrection with
				which he threatened them to take place if what he said
				was true and they had become worthy of the punishment in
				Hell by denying it. The whole Surah is meant to answer
				this denial.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Surah opens with words to the effect: "A demander has
				demanded a torment, the torment which must befall the
				deniers; and when it takes place, there will be none to
				prevent it, but it will take place at its own appointed
				time. Allah has His own way of doing things, but He is
				not unjust. Therefore, have patience, O Prophet, at what
				they say. They think it is far off, but We see it as near
				at hand."
			</p>
			<p>
				Then it is said:"Resurrection, which they desire to be
				hastened out of jest and fun, is terrible, and when it
				comes, it will cause great distress to the culprits. At
				that time they will even be prepared to give away their
				wives and children and their nearest kinsfolk in ransom
				to escape the punishment, but they will not be able to
				escape it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then the people have been warned to the effect; "On that
				Day the destinies of men will be decided strictly on the
				basis of their belief and their conduct. Those who turn
				away from the Truth in the world and amass wealth and
				withhold it from the needy, will be doomed to Hell; and
				those who fear the punishment of God here, believe in the
				Hereafter, keep up the Prayer, discharge the rights of
				the needy out of their wealth, strictly avoid immoral and
				wicked deeds, practice honesty in all their dealings,
				fulfill their pledges and trust and bear true witness,
				will have a place of honor in Paradise."
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, the disbelievers of Makkah who rushed in
				upon the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) from every
				side as soon as they saw him, in order to make fun of
				him, have been warned to the effect: "If you do not
				believe, Allah will replace you by other people who will
				be better than you", and the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
				peace) has been consoled, so as to say: "Do not take to
				heart their mockery and jesting; leave them to indulge in
				their idle talk and foolish conduct if they are bent upon
				experiencing the disgrace and humiliation of the
				Resurrection; they will themselves see their evil end."'

				"Nuh" is the name of this Surah as well as the title of
				its subject matter, for in it, from beginning to the end,
				the story of the Prophet Noah has been related.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				This also is one of the earliest Surahs to be revealed at
				Makkah, but the internal evidence of its subject matter
				shows that it was sent down in the period when opposition
				to the Holy Prophet's message of Islam by the
				disbelievers of Makkah had grown very strong and active.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject">
			<p>
				In this surah the story of the Prophet Noah has not been
				related only for the sake of storytelling, but its object
				is to warn the disbelievers of Makkah, so as to say:
				"You, O people of Makkah, are adopting towards Muhammad
				(upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings) the same
				attitude as the people of the Prophet Noah had adopted
				towards him; if you do not change this attitude, you too
				would meet with the same end." This had not been said in
				so many words anywhere in the Surah, but in the
				background of the conditions under which this story was
				narrated to the people of Makkah, this subject itself
				became obvious.
			</p>
			<p>
				Vv. 2-4 briefly explain how he began his mission and what
				he preached. Then after suffering hardships and troubles
				in the way of preaching his mission for ages the report
				that he made to his Lord has been given in vv. 5-20. In
				it he states how he had been trying to bring his people
				to the right path and how his people had stubbornly
				opposed him.
			</p>
			<p>
				After this, the Prophet Noah's final submission has been
				recorded in vv. 21-24, in which he prays to his Lord,
				saying: "These people have rejected my invitation: they
				are blindly following their chiefs, who have devised a
				tremendous plot of deceit and cunning. Time now has come
				when these people should be deprived of every grace to
				accept guidance." This was not an expression of
				impatience by the Prophet Noah, but when after having
				preached his message under extremely trying circumstances
				for centuries be became utterly disappointed with his
				people, he formed the opinion that no chance whatever was
				left of their coming to the right path. His this opinion
				fully conformed to Allah's own decision. Thus, in the
				next verse (25), it has been said: "The torment of Allah
				descended on those people because of their misdeeds."
			</p>
			<p>
				In the concluding verse, the Prophet Noah's supplication
				that he made to his Lord, right at the time the torment
				descended, has been recorded. In it he prays for his own
				and for all the believers' forgiveness, and makes a
				submission to Allah to the effect: "Do not leave any of
				the disbelievers alive on the earth, for they have become
				utterly devoid of every good: they will not beget any but
				disbelieving and wicked descendent."
			</p>
			<p>
				While studying this Surah one should keep in view the
				details of the Prophet Noah's story which have been given
				in the Quran above. For this see Al-Araf: 59-64 Yunus:
				71,73, Hud: 25-49, Al-Mu'minun: 23-31, Ash- Shua'ra:
				105-122, Al-Ankabut: 14,15, As-Saaffat: 75-82, Al-Qamar:

		<section heading="Name">
			<p>
				"Al-Jinn" is the name of this Surah as well as the title
				of its subject matter, for in it the event of the Jinn's
				hearing the Quran and returning to their people to preach
				Islam to them, has been related in detail.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				According to a tradition related in Bukhari and Muslim,
				on the authority of Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas, once the
				Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) was going to Visit the
				Fair of Ukaz with some of his Companions. On the way be
				led the Fajr Prayer at Nakhlah. At that time a company of
				the jinn happened to pass that way. When they heard the
				Quran being recited, they tarried and listened to it
				attentively. This very event has been described in this
				Surah.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most of the commentators, on the basis of this tradition,
				believe that this relates to the Holy Prophet's well
				known journey to Taif, which had taken place three years
				before the Hijrah in the 10th year of the Prophethood.
				But this is not correct for several reasons. The jinn's
				hearing the Quran during the journey to Taif has been
				related in Al-Ahqaf 29-32. A cursory reading of those
				verses shows that the jinn who had believed after hearing
				the Quran on that occasion were already believers in the
				Prophet Moses and the previous scriptures. On the
				contrary, vv. 2-7 of this surah clearly show that the
				jinn who heard the Quran on this occasion were
				polytheists and deniers of the Hereafter and Prophethood.
				Then, it is confirmed historically that in his journey to
				Taif none accompanied the Holy Prophet except Hadrat Zaid
				bin Harithah. On the contrary, concerning this journey
				Ibn Abbas says that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
				was accompanied by some of his Companions. Furthermore,
				the traditions also agree that in that journey the jinn
				heard the Quran when the Holy Prophet had stopped at
				Nakhlah on his return journey from Taif to Makkah, and in
				this journey, according to the traditions of Ibn Abbas,
				the event of the jinn's hearing the Quran occurred when
				the Holy Prophet was going to Ukaz from Makkah.
				Therefore, in view of these reasons what seems to be
				correct is that in Surah Al-Ahqaf and Surah Al Jinn, one
				and the same event has not been narrated, but these were
				two separate events, which took place during two separate
				journeys.
			</p>
			<p>
				As far as Surah Al-Ahqaf is concerned, it is agreed that
				the event mentioned in it occurred on the return journey
				from Taif in the 10th year of Prophethood. As for the
				question, when this second event took place, its answer
				is not given by the tradition of Ibn Abbas, nor any other
				historical tradition shows as to when the Holy Prophet
				had gone to the Fair of Ukaz along with some of his
				Companions. However, a little consideration of vv 8-10 of
				this surah shows that this could only be an event of the
				earliest stage of Prophethood. In these verses it has
				been stated that before the appointment of the Holy
				Prophet (upon whom be peace) to Divine Mission the jinn
				used to have one or another opportunity to eavesdrop in
				the heavens in order to hear news of the unseen, but
				after it they suddenly found that angels had been set as
				guards and meteorites were being shot on every side so
				that they could find no place of safety from where they
				could hear the secret news. Thereupon they had set about
				searching for the unusual thing that had occurred on the
				earth, or was going to occur, because of which the
				security measures had been tightened up. Probably since
				then many companies of the jinn must have been moving
				about in search of the unusual occurrence and one of them
				after having heard the Quran from the Holy Prophet (upon
				whom be peace) must have formed the opinion that that was
				the very thing for the sake of which all the gates of the
				heavens had been shut against the jinn.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Reality of Jinn">
			<p>
				Before one starts the study of this Surah one must
				clearly know what is the reality of the jinn so as to
				avoid any possible mental confusion. Many people of the
				modern times are involved in the misunderstanding that
				the jinn are not real, but only a figment of the ancient
				superstition and myths. They have not formed this opinion
				on the basis that they have known all the realities and
				truths about the universe and have thus discovered that
				the jinn do not exist. They cannot claim to possess any
				such knowledge either. But they have assumed without
				reason and proof that nothing exists in the universe
				except what they can see, whereas the sphere of human
				perceptions as against the vastness of this great
				universe is not even comparable to a drop of water as
				against the ocean. Here, the person who thinks that what
				he does not perceive, does not exist, and what exists
				must necessarily be perceived, in fact, provides a proof
				of the narrowness of his own mind. With this mode of
				thought, not to speak of the jinn, man cannot even accept
				and acknowledge any reality, which he cannot directly
				experience and observe, and he cannot even admit the
				existence of God, to say nothing of admitting any other
				unseen reality.
			</p>
			<p>
				Those of the Muslims who have been influenced by
				modernism, but cannot deny the Quran either, have given
				strange interpretations of the clear statements of the
				Quran about the jinn, Iblis and Satan. They say that this
				does not refer to any hidden creation, which may have its
				own independent existence, but it sometimes implies man's
				own animal forces, which have been called Satan, and
				sometimes it implies savage and wild mountain tribes, and
				sometimes the people who used to listen to the Quran
				secretly. But the statements of the Quran in this regard
				are so clear and explicit that these interpretations bear
				no relevance to them whatever.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Quran frequently mentions the jinn and the men in a
				manner as to indicate that they are two separate
				creations. For this, see Al Araf: 38, Hind : 119, Ha Mim
				As-Sajdah: 25,29, Ahqaf: 18, Adh Dhariyat: 56, and the
				entire surah Ar-Rahman, which bears such clear evidence
				as to leave no room to regard the jinn as a human
				species.
			</p>
			<p>
				In Surah Al-Araf: 12, Al Hijr : 26-27 and Ar-Rahman :
				14-19, it has been expressly stated that man was created
				out of clay and jinn out of fire.
			</p>
			<p>
				In Surah Al Hijr: 27, it has been said that the jinn had
				been created before man. The same thing is testified by
				the story of Adam and Iblis, which has been told at seven
				different places in the Quran, and at every place it
				confirms that Iblis was already there at the creation of
				man. Moreover, in surah Al-Kahf: 50, it has been stated
				that Iblis belonged to the jinn.
			</p>
			<p>
				In surah Al-Araf: 27, it has been stated in clear words
				that the jinn see the human beings but the human beings
				do not see them.
			</p>
			<p>
				In surah Al-Hijr: 16-l8, surah As-Saaffat: 6-10 and surah
				Al-Mulk: 5, it has been said that although the jinn can
				ascend to the heavens, they cannot exceed a certain
				limit; if they try to ascend beyond that limit and try to
				hear what goes on in the heavens, they are not allowed to
				do so, and if they try to eavesdrop they are driven away
				by meteorites. By this the belief of the polytheistic
				Arabs that the jinn possess the knowledge of the unseen,
				or have access to Divine secrets, has been refuted. The
				same error has also been refuted in Saba: 14.
			</p>
			<p>
				Al-Baqarah: 30-34 and Al-Kahf: 50 show that Allah has
				entrusted man with the vicegerency of the earth and the
				men are superior to the jinn. Although the jinn also have
				been given certain extraordinary powers and abilities an
				example of which is found in An-Naml 39, yet the animals
				likewise have been given some powers greater than man,
				but these are no argument that the animals are superior
				to man.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Quran also explains that the jinn, like men, are a
				creation possessed of power and authority, and they, just
				like them, can choose between obedience and disobedience,
				faith and disbelief. This is confirmed by the story of
				Satan and the event of the jinn affirming the faith as
				found in Surahs Al-Ahqaf and Al-Jinn.
			</p>
			<p>
				At scores of places in the Quran, it has also been stated
				that Iblis at the very creation of Adam had resolved to
				misguide mankind, and since then the Satanic jinn have
				been persistently trying to mislead man, but they do not
				have the power to overwhelm him and make him do something
				forcibly. However, they inspire him with evil
				suggestions, beguile him and make evil seem good to him.
				For this, see An-Nisa 117-120, Al-Araf: 11-17, Ibrahim
				22, Al-Hijr 30-42, An-Nahl 98-100, Bani Israel 61-65.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Quran also tells us that in the pre-Islamic ignorance
				the polytheistic Arabs regarded the jinn as associates of
				God, worshipped them and thought they were descended from
				God. For this, see A1-An'am: 100, Saba: 40-41, Assaffat:
				158.
			</p>
			<p>
				From these details, it becomes abundantly clear that the
				jinn have their own objective existence and are a
				concealed creation of an entirely different species from
				man. Because of their mysterious qualities, ignorant
				people have formed exaggerated notions and concepts about
				them and their powers, and have even worshipped them, but
				the Quran has explained the whole truth about them, which
				shows what they are and what they are not.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Topics">
			<p>
				In this Surah in vv. 1-15, it has been told what was the
				impact of the Quran on the company of the jinn when they
				heard it and what they said to their fellow jinn when
				they returned to them. Allah, in this connection, has not
				cited their whole conversation but only those particular
				things which were worthy of mention. That is why the
				style is not that of a continuous speech but sentences
				have been cited so as to indicate that they said this and
				this. If one studies these sentences spoken by the jinn
				carefully, one can easily understand the real object of
				the narration of this event of their affirming the faith
				and or mentioning this conversation of theirs with their
				people in the Quran.
			</p>
			<p>
				After this, in vv. 16-18, the people have been admonished
				to the effect: "If you refrain from polytheism and follow
				the way of righteousness firmly, you will be blessed;
				otherwise if you turn away from the admonition sent down
				by Allah, you will meet with a severe punishment." Then,
				in vv. 19-23, the disbelievers of Makkah have been
				reproached, as if to say: When the Messenger of Allah
				calls you towards Allah, you surround and mob him from
				every side, whereas the only duty of the Messenger is to
				convey the messages of Allah. He does not claim to have
				any power to bring any gain or cause any harm to the
				people." Then, in vv. 24-25 the disbelievers have been
				warned to the effect: "Today you are trying to overpower
				and suppress the Messenger seeing that he is helpless and
				friendless, but a time will come when you will know who
				in actual fact is helpless and friendless. Whether that
				time is yet far off, or near at hand, the Messenger has
				no knowledge thereof, but it will come to pass in any
				case." In conclusion, the people have been told: The
				Knower of the unseen is Allah alone. The Messenger
				receives only that knowledge which Allah is pleased to
				give him. This knowledge pertains to matters connected
				with the performance of the duties of Prophethood and it
				is delivered to him in such security which does not admit
				of any external interference whatever.

		<section heading="Name">
			<p>
				The Surah has been so designated after the word
				al-muzzammil occurring in the very first verse. This is
				only a name and not a title of its subject matter.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				The two sections of this Surah were revealed in two
				separate periods. The first section (vv. 1-19) is
				unanimously a Makki Revelation, and this is supported
				both by its subject matter and by the traditions of the
				Hadith. As for the question, in which specific period of
				the life at Makkah it was revealed, it is not answered by
				the tradition, but the internal evidence of the subject
				matter of this section helps to determine the period of
				its revelation.
			</p>
			<p>
				First, in it the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) has
				been instructed to the effect: "Arise during the night
				and worship Allah so that you may develop the capability
				to shoulder the heavy burden of Prophethood and to
				discharge its responsibilities." This shows that this
				Command must have been given in the earliest period of
				the Prophethood when training was being imparted to the
				Holy prophet by Allah for this office.
			</p>
			<p>
				Secondly, a Command has been given in it that the Quran
				be recited in the Tahajjud Prayer for half the night, or
				thereabouts. This Command by itself points out that by
				that time at least so much of the Quran had been revealed
				as could be recited for that long.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thirdly, in this section the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
				peace) has been exhorted to have patience at the excesses
				being committed by his opponents, and the disbelievers of
				Makkah have been threatened with the torment. This shows
				that this section was revealed at a time when the Holy
				Prophet (upon whom be peace) had openly started preaching
				Islam and the opposition to him at Makkah had grown
				active and strong.
			</p>
			<p>
				About the second section (v. 20) although many of the
				commentators have expressed the opinion that this too was
				sent down at Makkah, yet some other commentators regard
				it as a Madani Revelation, and this same opinion is
				confirmed by the subject matter of this section. For it
				mentions fighting in the way of Allah, and obviously,
				there could be no question of it at Makkah; it also
				contains the Command to pay the obligatory zakat, and it
				is fully confirmed that the zakat at a specific rate and
				with an exemption limit (nisab) was enjoined at Madinah.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				In the first seven verses the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
				peace) has been commanded to the effect: "Prepare
				yourself to shoulder the responsibilities of the great
				Mission that has been entrusted to you; its practical
				form is that you should rise during the hours of night
				and stand up in Prayer for half the night, or for a
				little more or less of it."
			</p>
			<p>
				In vv. 8-14, he has been exhorted to the effect: "Devote
				yourself exclusively to that God Who is the Owner of the
				whole universe, entrust all your affairs to Him with full
				satisfaction of the heart. Bear with patience whatever
				your opponents may utter against you. Do not be intimate
				with them. Leave their affair to God: He Himself will
				deal with them."
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, in vv. 15-19, those of the people of Makkah, who
				were opposing the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) have
				been warned, so as to say: "We have sent a Messenger to
				you just as We sent a Messenger to the Pharaoh. Just
				consider what fate the Pharaoh met when he did not accept
				the invitation of the Messenger of Allah. Supposing that
				you are not punished by a torment in this world, how will
				you save yourselves from the punishment for disbelief on
				the Day of Resurrection."
			</p>
			<p>
				This is the subject matter of the first section. The
				second section, according to a tradition from Hadrat
				Sa'id bin Jubair, was sent down ten years later, and in
				it the initial Command given in connection with the
				Tahajjud Prayer, in the beginning of the first section,
				was curtailed. The new Command enjoined, "Offer as much
				of the Tahajjud Prayer as you easily can, but what the
				Muslims should particularly mind and attend to is the
				five times obligatory Prayer a day, they should establish
				it regularly and punctually; they should discharge their
				zakat dues accurately; and they should spend their wealth
				with sincere intentions for the sake of Allah. In
				conclusion, the Muslims have been exhorted, saying:
				"Whatever good works you do in the world, will not go
				waste, but they are like the provision which a traveler
				sends up in advance to his permanent place of residence.
				Whatever good you send up from the world, you will find
				it with Allah, and the provision thus sent up is much
				better than what you will have to leave behind in the
				world, and with Allah you will also get a much better and
				richer reward than what you have actually sent up
				before."

				The first seven verses of this Surah belong to the
				earliest period at Makkah. Even according to some
				traditions which have been related in Bukhari, Muslim,
				Tirmidhi, Musnad Ahmad, etc., on the authority of Hadrat
				Jabir bin Abdullah, these are the very earliest verses of
				the Quran to be revealed to the Holy Prophet (upon whom
				be peace). But the Muslim Ummah almost unanimously agreed
				that the earliest Revelation to the Holy Prophet (upon
				whom be peace) consisted of the first five verses of
				Surah Al-Alaq (XCVI) However, what is established by
				authentic traditions is that after this first Revelation,
				no Revelation came down to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
				peace) for quite some time. Then, when it was resumed, it
				started with theme verses of Surah Al-Muddaththir. Imam
				Zuhri has given the following details of it:
			</p>
			<p>
				"Revelation to the Holy Prophet remained suspended for
				quite some time, and it was such a period of deep grief
				and distress for him that he started going early to the
				tops of the mountains to throw himself down from them.
				But whenever he stood on the edge of a peak, the Angel
				Gabriel would appear and tell him that he was Allah's
				Prophet. This would console him and restore to him full
				peace of mind." (Ibn Jarir). After this Imam Zuhri
				relates the following tradition on the authority of
				Hadrat Jabir bin Abdullah; "The Holy Messenger of Allah
				describing the period of falrat al-wahi (break in
				revelation) said: One day when I was passing on the way,
				I suddenly heard a call from heaven. I raised my head and
				saw that the same Angel who had visited me in the Cave of
				Hira was sitting on a throne between heaven and earth.
				This struck terror in my heart, and reaching home
				quickly, I said: 'Cover me up, cover me up'. So the
				people of the house covered me up with a quilt (or
				blanket). At that time Allah sent down the Revelation: Ya
				ayyuhal-Muddaththiru... From then on revelation became
				intense and continuous." (Bukhari, Muslim Musnad Ahmad,
				Ibn Jarir).
			</p>
			<p>
				The rest of the Surah (vv. 8-56) was revealed when the
				first Hajj season came after public preaching of Islam
				had begun in Makkah. This has been fully well described
				in the Surah by Ibn Hishan and we shall cite it below.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject. Matter">
			<p>
				As has been explained above, the earliest Revelation to
				the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) consisted of the
				first five verses of Surah Al-Alaq, in which it had been
				Said: "Read (O Prophet), in the name of your Lord, Who
				created: created man from a clot of congealed blood.
				Read: and your Lord is Most Generous, Who taught
				knowledge by the pen, taught man what he did not know."
			</p>
			<p>
				This was the first experience of Revelation met with
				suddenly by the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace). in
				this message it was not told what great mission he had
				been entrusted with and what duties he had to perform in
				future. He was only initiated into it and then left alone
				for a time so that the great strain this experience had
				caused should pass away and he should mentally become
				prepared to receive the Revelation and perform the
				prophetic mission in the future. After this intermission
				when Revelation Was resumed, the first seven verses of
				this Surah were revealed: In these he Was for the first
				time commanded to arise and warn the people of the
				consequences of the way of life they were following and
				to proclaim the greatness of God in the world where
				others were being magnified without any right. Along with
				that he was given this instruction: The demand of the
				Unique mission that you have to perform, now is that your
				life should be pure in every respect and you should carry
				out the duty of reforming your people sincerely
				irrespective of any worldly gain. Then, in the last
				sentence, he was exhorted to endure with patience, for
				the sake of his Lord, all the hardships and troubles that
				he might have to face while performing his mission.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the implementation of this Divine Command when the
				Holy Messenger of Allah began to preach Islam and recite
				the Quranic Surahs revealed successively, the people of
				Makkah felt alarmed, and it provoked a great storm of
				opposition and hostility. A few months passed in this
				state until the Hajj season approached. The people of
				Makkah feared that if Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's
				peace) started visiting the caravans of the pilgrims
				coming from all over Arabia at their halting places and
				reciting the spellbinding and unique Revelations of the
				Quran in their assemblies on the occasion of Hajj, his
				message would reach every part of Arabia and influence
				countless people. Therefore, the Quraish chiefs held a
				conference and settled that they would start a propaganda
				campaign against the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
				among the pilgrims as soon as they arrived. After they
				had agreed on this, Walid bin al-Mughirah said to the
				assembled people: "If you said contradictory things about
				Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings), we
				all would lose our trust among the people. Therefore, let
				us agree upon one opinion, which we should all say
				without dispute. Some people said that they would call
				Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings) a
				soothsayer. Walid said: No, by God, be is not a
				soothsayer. We have seen the soothsayers: what they
				murmur and what they utter has no remote resemblance with
				the Quran. Some other people said: Then we say be is
				possessed. Walid said: He is not a possessed one: we have
				seen bad and insane people; the way one talks
				disjointedly and behaves foolishly in that state is known
				to all: who would believe that what Muhammad (upon whom
				be peace) presented was the incoherent speech of a
				madman? The people said: Then we say he is a poet. Walid
				said: No, he is not a poet, for we know poetry in all its
				forms, and what he presents conforms to no form of it.
				The people said: Then he is a sorcerer. Walid said: He is
				no sorcerer either: we have seen sorcerers and we also
				know what methods they adopt for their sorcery. This also
				does not apply to Muhammad. Then he said: "Whichever of
				these things you said about Muhammad, it would be known
				to be a false accusation. By God, his speech is sweet,
				his root is deep and his branches are fruitful. At this
				Abu Jahl, urging on Walid, said: Your people will never
				be pleased with you unless you say something about
				Muhammad. He said: Let me think over it awhile. Then,
				after prolonged thought and consideration, he said: The
				nearest thing to the truth is that you tell the Arabs
				that he is a sorcerer, who has brought a message by which
				he separates a man from his father; and from his brother,
				and from his wife and children, and from his family. They
				all agreed on what Walid had proposed. Then, according to
				a scheme the men of Quraish spread among the pilgrims in
				the Hajj season and they warned everyone they met of the
				sorcery of Muhammad (upon whom be peace) and of his
				stirring up divisions in the families by it." But the
				result was that by their this plan the Quraish chiefs
				themselves made the name of the Holy Messenger known
				throughout Arabia. (Ibn Hisham, pp. 288-289. That Walid
				had made this proposal on the insistence of Abu Jahl has
				been related by Ibn Jarir in his Tafsir on the authority
				of Ikrimah).
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, it has been explicitly stated: Allah does
				not stand in need of anybody's faith that He may fulfill
				his conditions. The Quran is an admonition that has been
				presented before the people openly; now whoever wills may
				accept it. Allah has a right that the people should fear
				His disobedience and He alone has the power to forgive
				the one who adopts piety and an attitude of God
				consciousness even though one may have committed many
				acts of disobedience in the past.

	<sura num="75">
		<section heading="Name">
			<p>
				The Surah has been so named after the word al-Qiyamah in
				the first verse. This is not only the name but also the
				title of this Surah, for it is devoted to Resurrection
				itself.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				Although there is no tradition to indicate its period of
				revelation, yet there is in the subject matter of this
				Surah an internal evidence, which shows that it is one of
				the earliest Surahs to be sent down at Makkah. After
				verse 15 the discourse is suddenly interrupted and the
				Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) told: "Do not move your
				tongue to remember this Revelation hastily. It is Our
				responsibility to have it remembered and read. Therefore,
				when We are reciting it, listen to its recital carefully.
				Again, it is Our responsibility to explain its meaning."
				Then, from verse 20 onward the same theme which was
				interrupted at verse 15, is resumed. This parenthetical
				passage, according to both the context and the
				traditions, has been interposed here for the reason that
				when the Angel Gabriel was reciting this Surah to the
				Holy Prophet, the Holy Prophet, lest he should forget its
				words later, was repeating them at the same moment. This
				in fact happened at the time when the coming down and
				receipt of Revelation was yet a new experience for him
				and he was not yet fully used to receiving it calmly.
				There are two other instances also of this in the Quran.
				First, in Surah Ta Ha the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
				peace) has been told: "And see that you do not hasten to
				recite the Quran belore its revelation is completed to
				you." (v. 114). Then, in Surah Al-A'la, it has been said:
				"We shall enable you to recite:, then you shall never
				forget." (v. 6). Later, when the Holy Prophet became
				fully used to receiving the Revelation well, there
				remained no need to give him any such instruction. That
				is why except for these three, there is no other instance
				of this in the Quran.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				Most of the Surahs, from here till the end of the Quran,
				in view of their content and style, seem to have been
				sent down in the period when after the first seven verses
				of Surah Al-Muddaththir, revelation of the Quran began
				like a shower of rain: Thus, in the successively revealed
				Surahs Islam and its fundamental concepts and moral
				teachings were presented so forcefully and effectively in
				pithy, brief sentences and the people of Makkah warned so
				vehemently on their errors and deviations that the
				Quraish chiefs were utterly confounded. Therefore, before
				the next Hajj season came they held the conference for
				devising schemes to defeat the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
				peace) as has been mentioned in the Introduction to the
				Surah Al-Muddaththir above.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this Surah, addressing the deniers of the Hereafter,
				replies have been given to each of their doubts and
				objections, strong arguments have been given to prove the
				possibility, occurrence and necessity of the Resurrection
				and Hereafter, and also it has been pointed out clearly
				that the actual reason of the people's denying the
				Hereafter is not that they regard it as impossible
				rationally but because their selfish motives do not allow
				them to affirm it. At the same time, the people have been
				warned, as if to say: "The event, the occurrence of which
				you deny, will inevitably come: all your deeds will be
				brought and placed before you. As a matter of fact, even
				before any of you sees his record, he will be knowing
				fully well what he has done in the world, for no man is
				unaware of himself, no matter what excuses and pretenses
				he may offer to deceive the world and deceive himself in
				respect of his misdeeds."

				This Surah is called Ad-Dahr as well as Al-Insan
			</p>
			<p>
				after the words occurring in the first verse.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				Most of the commentators, including Allama Zamakhshari,
				Imam Razi, Qadi, Baidawi, Allama Nizam ad-Din Nisaburi,
				Hafiz Ibn Kathir and many others, regard it as a Makki
				Surah, and, according to Allam Alusi, the same is the
				opinion of the majority of scholars. However, some
				commentators hold the view that the Surah was revealed at
				Madinah, and some others say that it was revealed at
				Makkah but vv. 8-10 of it were sent down at Madinah.
			</p>
			<p>
				As far as the subject matter and the style of the Surah
				are concerned, these are very different from those of the
				Madani Surahs. A little study of it rather shown that it
				is not only a Makki Surah but it was revealed during the
				earliest period at Makkah, which began just after the
				revelation of the first seven verses of Surah
				Al-Muddaththir. As for vv. 8-10, they are so naturally
				set in the theme of the Surah that if they are read in
				their proper context, no one can say that the theme
				preceding and following them had been sent down 15 to 16
				years earlier but these three verses which were revealed
				many years later were inserted here unnaturally.
			</p>
			<p>
				In fact, the basis of the idea that this Surah; or some
				verses of it were revealed at Madinah, is a tradition
				which Ata has related from Ibn Abbas (may Allah bless
				him). He says that once Hadrat Hasan and Husain fell ill.
				The Holy Prophet and some of his Companions visited them.
				They wished Hadrat Ali to make a vow to Allah for the
				recovery of the two children. Thereupon, Hadrat All,
				Hadrat Fatimah and Fiddah their maid servant, vowed a
				fast of three days if Allah restored the children to
				health. The children recovered by the grace of Allah and
				the three of them began to fast as avowed. As there was
				nothing to eat in the house, Hadrat Ali borrowed three
				measures (sa') of barley from somebody (according to
				another tradition, earned through labor). When on the
				first day they sat down to eat after breaking the fast, a
				poor man came and begged for food. They gave all their
				food to him, drank water and retired to bed. The next day
				when they again sat down to eat after breaking the fast,
				an orphan came and begged for something. They again gave
				away the whole food to him, drank water and went to bed.
				On the third day when they were just going to eat after
				breaking the fast, a captive came up and begged for food
				likewise. Again the whole food was given away to him. On
				the fourth day Hadrat Ali took both the children with him
				and went before the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace).
				The Holy Prophet (on whom be peace) seeing the weak
				condition of the three, returned with them to the house
				of Hadrat Fatimah and found her lying in a corner half
				dead with hunger. This moved him visibly. In the meantime
				the Angel Gabriel (peace be on him) came and said; "Look,
				Allah has congratulated you on the virtues of the people
				of your house!" When the Holy Prophet asked what it was,
				he recited this whole Surah in response. (According to
				Ibn Mahran's tradition, he recited it from verse 5 till
				the end. But the tradition which Ibn Marduyah has related
				from Ibn Abbas only says that the verse Wff yut'imun-at
				ta'am...was sent down concerning Hadrat Ali and Hadrat
				Fatimah; there is no mention of this story in it). This
				whole story has been narrated by Ali bin Ahmad al-Wahidi
				in his Commentary of the Quran, entitled Al'Basit, and
				probably from the same it has been taken by Zamakhshari,
				Razi, Nisaburi and others.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the first place, this tradition is very weak as
				regards its chain of transmission. Then, from the point
				of view of its subject matter also, it is strange that
				when a poor man, or an orphan, or a captive, comes to beg
				for food, he is given all the food. He could be given one
				member's food and the five of them could share the rest
				of it among themselves. Then this also is incredible that
				illustrious persons like Hadrat Ali and Hadrat Fatimah,
				who possessed perfect knowledge of Islam, should have
				regarded it as an act of virtue to keep the two children,
				who had just recovered their health and were still weak,
				hungry for three consecutive days. Moreover, in respect
				of the captives also, it has never been a practice under
				the Islamic government that they should be left to beg
				for food for themselves. For if they were prisoners of
				the government, the government itself was responsible to
				arrange food and clothing for them, and if they were in
				an individual's custody, he was made responsible to feed
				and clothe them. Therefore, it was not possible that in
				Madinah a captive should have gone about begging food
				from door to door. However, overlooking the weaknesses of
				transmission and the probability of subject matter, even
				if the narrative is accepted as it goes, at the most what
				it shows is that when the people of the Holy Prophet's
				house acted righteously as they did, Gabriel came and
				gave him the good news that Allah had much appreciated
				their act of virtue, for they had acted precisely in the
				righteous way that Allah had commanded in these verses of
				Surah Ad-Dahr. This does not necessitate that these
				verses too were sent down on that very occasion. The same
				is the case with many traditions concerning the occasion
				of revelation. When about a certain verse it is said that
				it was sent down on a particular occasion, it in fact
				does not mean that the verse was sent down on the very
				occasion the incident took place. But it means that the
				verse applies precisely and exactly to the incident. Imam
				Suyuti in Al-Itqan has quoted this from Hafiz Ibn
				Taimiyyah: "When the reporters say that a verse was sent
				down concerning a particular incident, it sometimes
				implies that the same incident (or matter) occasioned its
				revelation, and sometimes that the verse applies to the
				matter although it may not have occasioned its
				revelation."Further on he quotes Imam Badr ad-Din
				Zarkashi's view from his Al-Burhan fi Ulum al-Quran:"It
				is well known in respect of the Companions and their
				immediate successors that when one of them says that a
				verse was sent down concerning a particular matter, it
				means that the ruling contained in it applied to that
				matter and not that the matter itself occasioned the
				revelation of the verse. Thus, it only uses the ruling of
				the verse for the purpose of reasoning and not for
				stating a fact." (Al- Itqan fi Ulum al-Quran, vol. I, p.
				31, Ed. 1929).

		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				The theme of this Surah is to inform man of his true
				position in the world and to tell him that if he
				understood his true position rightly and adopted the
				attitude of gratefulness, he would meet with such and
				such good end, and if he adopted the way of disbelief, he
				would meet with such and such evil ends. In the longer
				Surahs of the Quran this same theme has been presented at
				length, but a special characteristic of the style of the
				earliest Surahs revealed at Makkah is that the subjects
				dealt with at length in the later period, "have been
				presented in a brief but highly effective way in this
				period in such concise, elegant sentences as may
				automatically be preserved in the memory of the hearers."
			</p>
			<p>
				In this Surah, first of all man has been reminded that
				there was a time when he was nothing; then a humble
				beginning of him was made with a mixed drop of sperm and
				ovum of which even his mother was not aware; even she did
				not know that he had been conceived nor anyone else
				seeing the microscopic cell could say that it was a man,
				who in future would become the best of creation on the
				earth. After this, man has been warned, so as to say:
				"Beginning your creation in this way We have developed
				and shaped you into what you are today in order to test
				and try you in the world. That is why, unlike other
				creatures, you were made intelligent and sensible and
				were shown both the way of gratitude and the way of
				ingratitude clearly so that you may show, in the interval
				that you have been granted here for work, whether you
				have emerged as a grateful servant from the test or an
				unbelieving, ungrateful wretch!"
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, just in one sentence, it has been stated decisively
				what will be the fate to be met with in the Hereafter by
				those who emerged as unbelievers from this test.
			</p>
			<p>
				After this, in vv. 5-22 continuously, the blessings with
				which those who do full justice to servitude in the
				world, will be favored, have been mentioned in full
				detail. In these verses, not only have their best rewards
				been mentioned but they have also been told briefly what
				are the acts on the basis of which they would become
				worthy of those rewards. Another special characteristic
				of the earliest Surahs revealed at Makkah is that besides
				introducing in them briefly the fundamental beliefs and
				concepts of Islam, here and there, those moral qualities
				and virtuous acts have been mentioned, which are
				praiseworthy according to Islam, and also those evils of
				deed and morality of which Islam strives to cleanse human
				life. And these two things have not been mentioned with a
				view to show what good or evil result is entailed by them
				in the transitory life of the world, but they have been
				mentioned only to point out what enduring results they
				will produce in the eternal and everlasting life of the
				Hereafter, irrespective of whether an evil quality may
				prove useful or a good quality may prove harmful in the
				world.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is the subject matter of the first section (vv.
				1-22). In the second section, addressing the Holy Prophet
				(upon whom be peace), three things have been stated:
				first, that "it is in fact We Ourself Who are revealing
				this Quran piecemeal to you, and this is intended to
				inform the disbelievers, not you, that the Quran is not
				being fabricated by Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace
				and blessings) but it is "We Who are revealing it, and it
				is Our Own wisdom which requires that We should reveal it
				piece by piece and not all at once." Second, the Holy
				Prophet has been told: "No matter how long it may take
				for the decree of your Lord to be enforced and no matter
				what afflictions may befall you in the meantime, in any
				case you should continue to perform your mission of
				Apostleship patiently, and not to yield to the pressure
				tactics of any of these wicked and unbelieving people."
				The third thing he has been told is: "Remember Allah day
				and night, perform the Prayer and spend your nights in
				the worship of Allah, for it is these things which
				sustain and strengthen those who call to Allah in the
				face of iniquity and disbelief."
			</p>
			<p>
				Then in one single sentence, the actual cause of the
				disbelievers' wrong attitude has been stated: they have
				forgotten the Hereafter and are enamored of the world. In
				the second sentence, they have been warned to the effect:
				"You have not come into being by yourself: We have
				created you. You have not made these broad chests, and
				strong, sturdy hands and feet for yourselves, it is We
				Who made these for you; and it so lies in Our power to
				treat you as We please. We can distort your figures, We
				can destroy you and replace you by some other nation. We
				can cause you to die and can recreate you in whatever
				form we like."
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, it has been said: This is an Admonition:
				whoever wills may accept it and take a path to his Lord.
				But man's own will and desire is not everything in the
				world. No one's will and desire can be fulfilled unless
				Allah (also) so wills. And Allah's willing is not
				haphazard: whatever He wills, He wills it on the basis of
				His knowledge and wisdom. He admits into His mercy
				whomever He regards as worthy of His mercy on the basis
				of His knowledge and wisdom, and He has prepared a
				painful torment for those whom He finds unjust and
				wicked.

	<sura num="77">
		<section heading="Name">
			<p>
				The Surah takes its name from the word wal-mursalat in
				the first verse.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				Its subject matter bears full evidence that it was
				revealed in the earliest period at Makkah. If this Surah
				is read together with the two Surahs preceding it, namely
				Al-Qiyamah and Ad-Dahr, and the two Surahs following it,
				namely An-Naba and An-Naziat, it becomes obvious that all
				these Surahs are the Revelations of the same period, and
				they deal with one and the same theme, which has been
				impressed on the people of Makkah in different ways.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				Its theme is to affirm the Resurrection and Hereafter and
				to warn the people of the consequences which will
				ultimately follow the denial and the affirmation of these
				truths.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the first seven verses, the system of winds has been
				presented as an evidence of the truth that the
				Resurrection which is being foretold by the Quran and the
				Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and
				blessings) must come to pass. The reasoning is that the
				power of All-Mighty Allah Who established this wonderful
				system on the earth, cannot be helpless in bringing about
				the Resurrection, and the express wisdom which underlies
				this system bears full evidence that the Hereafter must
				appear, for no act of an All-Wise Creator can be vain and
				purposeless, and if there was no Hereafter, it would mean
				that the whole of one's life was useless and absurd.
			</p>
			<p>
				The people of Makkah repeatedly asked, "Bring about the
				Resurrection with which you threaten us; only then shall
				we believe in it." In vv. 8-15, their demand has been
				answered, saying: "Resurrection is no sport or fun so
				that whenever a jester should ask for it, it should be
				brought forth immediately. It is indeed the Day of
				Judgment to settle the account of all mankind and of all
				its individuals. For it Allah has fixed a specific time
				it will take place at its own time, and when it takes
				place with all its dreads and horrors, it will confound
				those who are demanding it for fun today. Then their
				cases will be decided only on the evidence of those
				Messengers whom these deniers of the truth are
				repudiating with impunity. Then they will themselves
				realize how they themselves are responsible for their
				dooms."
			</p>
			<p>
				In vv. 16-28 arguments have been given continuously for
				the occurrence and necessity of the Resurrection and
				Hereafter. In these it has been stated that man's own
				history, his own birth, and the structure of the earth on
				which he lives, bear the testimony that the coming of
				Resurrection and the establishment of the Hereafter are
				possible as well as the demand of Allah Almighty's
				wisdom. History tells us that the nations which denied
				the Hereafter ultimately became corrupted and met with
				destruction. This means that the Hereafter is a truth
				which if denied and contradicted by a nation by its
				conduct and attitude, will cause it to meet the same
				doom, which is met by a blind man who rushes headlong
				into an approaching train. And it also means that in the
				kingdom of the universe only physical laws are not at
				work but a moral law also is working in it, under which
				in this very world the process of retribution is
				operating. But since in the present life of the world
				retribution is not taking place in its complete and
				perfect form, the moral law of the universe necessarily
				demands that there should come a time when it should take
				its full course and all those good works and evil deeds,
				which could not be rewarded here, or which escaped their
				due punishment should be fully rewarded and punished. For
				this it is inevitable that there should be a second life
				after death. If man only considers how he takes his birth
				in the world, his intellect, provided it is sound
				intellect, cannot deny that for the God Who began his
				creation from an insignificant sperm drop and developed
				him into a perfect man, it certainly possible to create
				the same man once again. After death the particles of
				man's body do not disappear but continue to exist on the
				same earth on which he lived his whole life. It is from
				the resources and treasures of this very earth that he is
				made and nourished and then into the same treasures of
				the earth he is deposited. The God who caused him to
				emerge from the treasures of the earth, in the first
				instance, can also cause him to re-emerge from the same
				treasures after he has been restored to them at death. If
				one only considers the powers of Allah, one cannot deny
				that He can do this; and if one considers the wisdom of
				Allah, one also cannot deny that it is certainly the very
				demand of His wisdom to call man to account for the right
				and wrong use of the powers that He has granted him on
				the earth; it would rather be against wisdom to let him
				off without rendering an account.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, in vv. 28-40, the fate of the deniers of the
				Hereafter has been depicted, and in vv. 41-45 of those
				who affirming faith in it in their worldly life,
				endeavored to improve their Hereafter, and abstained from
				the evils of disbelief and thought, morality and deed,
				conduct and character which might be helpful in man's
				worldly life, but are certainly ruinous for his life
				hereafter.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the end, the deniers of the Hereafter and those who
				turn away from God-worship, have been warned as if to
				say: "Enjoy your short-lived worldly pleasure as you may,
				but your end will ultimately be disastrous." The
				discourse concludes with the assertion that the one who
				fails to obtain guidance from a Book like the Quran, can
				have no ether source in the world to afford him Guidance.

	<sura num="78">
		<section heading="Name">
			<p>
				The Surah derived its name from the word an-Nabaa in the
				second verse. This is not only a name but also a title of
				its subject matter, for Nabaa implies the news of
				Resurrection and Hereafter and the whole Surah is devoted
				to the same theme.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				As we have explained in the introduction to Surah
				Al-Mursalat, the themes of all the Surahs, from Al-
				Qiyamah to An-Naziat, closely resemble one another, and
				all these seem to have been revealed in the earliest
				period at Makkah.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				Its theme also is the same as of Surah Al-Mursalat, i.e.
				to affirm the Resurrection and Hereafter, and to warn the
				people of the consequences of acknowledging or
				disacknowledging it.
			</p>
			<p>
				When the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) first started
				to preach Islam in Makkah, his message consisted of three
				elements: 
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					That none be held as an associate with Allah in
					Godhead; 
				</li>
				<li>
					That Allah had appointed him as His Messenger; 
				</li>
				<li>
					That this world will come to an end one day and
					then another world will be established when all
					the former and the latter generations will be
					resurrected with the same bodies in which they
					lived and worked in the world; then they will be
					called to account for their beliefs and deeds and
					those who emerge as believing and righteous in
					this accountability will go to Paradise and those
					who are proved to be disbelieving and wicked will
					live in Hell for ever.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Of these, although the first thing was highly unpleasant
				for the people of Makkah, yet in any case they were not
				disbelievers in the existence of Allah. They believed in
				His Being the Supreme Sustainer, Creator and Providence
				and also admitted that all those beings whom they
				regarded as their deities, were themselves Allah's
				creatures. Therefore, in this regard the only thing they
				disputed was whether they had any share in the attributes
				and powers of Divinity and in the Divine Being itself or
				not.
			</p>
			<p>
				As for the second thing, the people of Makkah were not
				prepared to accept it. However, what they could not
				possibly deny was that during the 40 years life that the
				Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) had lived among them
				before his claim to Prophethood, they had never found him
				a lying deceitful person or the one who would adopt
				unlawful methods for selfish ends. They themselves
				admitted that he was a man possessed of wisdom,
				righteousness and moral superiority. Therefore, in spite
				of charging him with a thousand false accusations, to say
				nothing of making others believe, they were finding it
				difficult even for themselves to believe that although he
				was an honest and upright man in every other affair and
				dealing of life, yet, God forbid, a liar only in his
				claim to be a Prophet.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thus, the first two things were not in fact so perplexing
				for the people of Makkah as the third thing. When this
				was presented before them, they mocked it most of all,
				expressed unusual wonder at it, and regarding it as
				remote from reason and impossible, started talking
				against it as incredible, even inconceivable, in their
				assemblies. But in order to bring them to the way of
				Islam it was absolutely essential that the doctrine of
				the Hereafter should be instilled into their minds, for
				without belief in this doctrine, it was not at all
				possible that they could adopt a serious attitude with
				regard to the truth and falsehood, could change their
				standard of values in respect of good and evil, and
				giving up worship of the world, could be inclined to
				follow the way that Islam urged them to follow. That is
				why in the earliest Surahs revealed at Makkah the
				doctrine of the Hereafter has been impressed and stressed
				more than anything else. However, the arguments for it
				have been given in such a way that the doctrine of the
				Oneness of God (Tauhid) also is impressed on the minds
				automatically. This also contains brief arguments, here
				and there, to confirm the truth of the Holy Messenger of
				Allah and the Quran.
			</p>
			<p>
				After understanding well why the theme of the Hereafter
				has been so frequently repeated in the Surahs of this
				period, let us now have a look at the subject matter of
				this Surah. In it first of all, allusion has been made to
				the common talk and the doubts that were being expressed
				in every street of Makkah and in every assembly of the
				people of Makkah on hearing the news about Resurrection.
				Then, the deniers have been asked: "Don't you see this
				earth which We have spread as a carpet for you? Don't you
				see the high mountains which we have so firmly placed in
				the earth? Don't you consider your own selves how We have
				created you as pairs of men and women? Don't you consider
				your sleep by which We make you seek a few hours rest
				after every few hours labor and toil so as to keep you
				fit for work in the world? Don't you see the alternation
				of the night and day which We are so regularly
				perpetuating precisely according to your needs and
				requirements? Don't you see the strongly fortified system
				of the heavens above you? Don't you see the sun by means
				of which you are receiving your light and heat? Don't you
				see the rains which fall from the clouds and help produce
				corn and vegetables and luxuriant gardens? Do these
				things only tell you that the power of the Almighty Being
				Who has created them, will be unable to bring about
				Resurrection and establish the Next World? Then, from the
				supreme wisdom which is clearly working in this world
				around you, do you only understand this that although
				each part of it and each function of it is purposive, yet
				life is meaningless? Nothing could be more absurd and
				meaningless that after appointing man to the office of
				foreman and granting him vast powers of appropriation, in
				this workhouse, when he leaves the world after fulfilling
				his role, he should be let off without any
				accountability. He should neither be rewarded and granted
				pension on satisfactory work, nor subjected to any
				accountability and punishment on unsatisfactory
				performance of duty.
			</p>
			<p>
				After giving these arguments it has been emphatically
				stated that the Day of Judgment shall certainly come to
				pass on its appointed time. No sooner is the Trumpet
				sounded than whatever is being foretold shall appear
				before the eyes, and whether you believe in it today, or
				not, at that time you will come out in your multitudes
				from wherever you would be lying dead and buried to
				render your account. Your denial cannot in any way avert
				this inevitable event.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, in vv. 21-30; it has been stated that every single
				misdeed of those who do not expect any accountability to
				take place and have thus belied Our Revelations, lies
				reckoned and recorded with Us, and Hell is ever lying an
				ambush to punish them and punish them fully for all their
				doings. Then, in vv. 31-36, the best rewards of those who
				lived as responsible people in the world and have
				provided for their Hereafter beforehand have been
				mentioned. They have been reassured that they will not
				only be rewarded richly for their services but in
				addition they will also be given sufficient gifts.
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, the Divine Court in the Hereafter has been
				depicted, making it plain that there will be no question
				of somebody's being adamant in the matter of getting his
				followers and associates forgiven, none will speak
				without leave, and leave will be granted on the condition
				that intercession be made only for the one to whom leave
				of intercession will have been given, and the intercessor
				will say only what is right. Moreover, leave for
				intercession will be given only for those who had
				acknowledged the Truth in the world but were sinners;
				rebels of God and rejecters of the Truth will deserve no
				intercession at all.
			</p>
			<p>
				The discourse has been concluded with this warning: The
				Day the coming of which is being foretold, shall
				certainly come to pass. Do not think it is yet far off,
				it is close at hand. Now, whoever wills, let him believe
				in it and take the way towards his Lord. But he who
				disbelieves, in spite of the warning, "will have all his
				deeds placed before him: and he will exclaim regretfully:
				"Oh, would that I were not born in the world!" At that
				time, his regrets will be about the same world of which
				he is so enamored today!

	<sura num="79">
		<section heading="Name">
			<p>
				It is derived from the word wan-nazi'at with which the
				Surah opens.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				According to Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas, this Surah was
				sent down after Surah An-Naba. Its subject matter also
				testifies that it belongs to the earliest period at
				Makkah.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				Its theme is affirmation of Resurrection and the life
				hereafter; it also warns of the consequences of belying
				the Messenger of God.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Surah opens with oaths sworn by the angels who take
				the soul at deaths and those who hasten to carry out
				Allah's Commands, and those who conduct the affairs of
				the universe according to Divine Will, to assure that the
				Resurrection will certainly come to pass and the second
				life after death will certainly take place. For the
				angels who are employed to pluck out the soul today can
				also be employed to restore the soul tomorrow, and the
				angels who promptly execute Allah's Commands and conduct
				the affairs of the universe today can also upset the
				order of the universe tomorrow by orders of the same God
				and can also bring about a new order.
			</p>
			<p>
				After this the people have been told, so as to say: "This
				work which you regard as absolutely impossible, is not
				any difficult for Allah, for which He may have to make
				lengthy preparations. Just a single jolt will upset this
				system of the world and a second jolt will be enough to
				cause you to appear as living beings in the new world. At
				that time the same people who were wont to deny it, would
				be trembling with fear and seeing with awe struck eyes
				all that they thought was impossible.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, relating the story of the Prophet Moses and Pharaoh
				briefly, the people have been warned to the effect: "You
				know full well what fate the Pharaoh met in consequence
				of belying the Messenger and rejecting the guidance
				brought by him and endeavoring to defeat his mission by
				trickery and deceit. If you do not learn any lesson from
				it and do not change your ways and attitude accordingly,
				you also will have to meet the same fate.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, in vv. 27-13, arguments have been given for the
				Hereafter and life after death. In this regard, the
				deniers have been asked the question: "Is your
				resurrection a more difficult task or the creation of the
				huge Universe which spreads around you to infinite
				distances with myriads of its stars and planets? Your
				recreation cannot be difficult for the God for Whom this
				was an easy task. Thus, after presenting, in a single
				sentence, a decisive argument for the possibility of the
				Hereafter, attention has been drawn to the earth and its
				provisions that have been arranged in it for the
				sustenance of man and animal and of which everything
				testifies that it has been created with great wisdom for
				fulfilling some special purpose. Pointing to this the
				question has been left for the intellect of man to ponder
				for itself and form the opinion whether calling man to
				account after having delegated authority and
				responsibilities to a creature like him in this wise
				system would be more in keeping with the demands of
				wisdom, or that he should die after committing all sorts
				of misdeeds in the world and should perish and mix in the
				dust for ever and should never be called to account as to
				how he employed the authority and fulfilled the
				responsibilities entrusted to him. Instead of discussing
				this question, in vv. 34-41, it has been said: "When the
				Hereafter is established, men's eternal future will be
				determined on the criterion as to which of them rebelled
				against his God transgressing the bounds of service and
				made the material benefits and pleasures his objective of
				life and which of them feared standing before his Lord
				and refrained from fulfilling the unlawful desires of the
				self." This by itself provides the right answer to the
				above question to every such person who considers it
				honestly, free from stubbornness. For the only rational,
				logical and moral demand of giving authority and
				entrusting responsibilities to man in the world is that
				he should be called to account on this very basis
				ultimately and rewarded or punished accordingly.
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, the question of the disbelievers of Makkah
				as to when Resurrection will take place, has been
				answered. They asked the Holy Prophet this question over
				and over again. In reply it has been said that the
				knowledge of the time of its occurrence rests with Allah
				alone. The Messenger is there only to give the warning
				that it will certainly come. Now whoever wishes may mend
				his ways, fearing its coming, and whoever wishes may
				behave and conduct himself as he likes, fearless of its
				coming. When the appointed time comes, those very people
				who loved the life of this world and regarded its
				pleasures as the only object of life, would feel that
				they had stayed in the world only for an hour or so. Then
				they will realize how utterly they had ruined their
				future for ever for the sake of the short lived pleasures
				of the world.

	<sura num="80">
		<section heading="Name">
			<p>
				The Surah is so designated after the word abasa with
				which it opens.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				The commentators and traditionists are unanimous about
				the occasion of the revelation of this Surah. According
				to them, once some big chiefs of Makkah were sitting in
				the Holy Prophet's assembly and he was earnestly engaged
				in trying to persuade them to accept Islam. At that very
				point, a blind man, named Ibn Umm Maktum, approached him
				to seek explanation of some point concerning Islam. The
				Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) disliked his
				interruption and ignored him. Thereupon Allah sent down
				this Surah. From this historical incident the period of
				the revelation of this Surah can be precisely determined.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the first place, it is confirmed that Hadrat Ibn Umm
				Maktum was one of the earliest converts to Islam. Hafiz
				Ibn Hajar and Hafiz Ibn Kathir have stated that he was
				one of those who had accepted Islam at a very early stage
				at Makkah.
			</p>
			<p>
				Secondly, some of the traditions of the Hadith which
				relate this incident show that he had already accepted
				Islam and some others show that be was inclined to accept
				it and had approached the Holy Prophet in search of the
				truth. Hadrat Aishah states that coming to the Holy
				Prophet he had said: "O Messenger of Allah, guide me to
				the straight path." (Tirmidhi, Hakim, Ibn Hibban, Ibn
				Jarir, Abu Ya'la. According to Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas,
				he had asked the meaning of a verse of the Quran and said
				to the Holy Prophet: "O Messenger of Allah, teach me the
				knowledge that Allah has taught you." Ibn Jarir, Ibn Abu
				Hatim). These statements show that he had acknowledged
				the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) as a Messenger of
				Allah and the Quran as a Book of Allah. Contrary to this,
				Ibn Zaid has interpreted the words la allahu yazzakka of
				verse 3 to mean: la allahu yuslim: "maybe that he accepts
				Islam." (Ibn Jarir) And Allah's own words: "What would
				make you know that he might reform, or heed the
				admonition, and admonishing might profit him?" and "The
				one who comes to you running, of his own will, and fears,
				from him you turn away", point out that by that time he
				had developed in himself a deep desire to learn the
				truth: he had come to the Holy Prophet with the belief
				that he was the only source of guidance and his desire
				would be satisfied only through him; his apparent state
				also reflected that if he was given instruction, he would
				benefit by it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thirdly, the names of the people who were sitting in the
				Holy Prophet's assembly at that time, have been given in
				different traditions. In this list we find the names of
				`Utbah, Shaibah, Abu Jahl, Umayyah bin Khalaf, Ubayy bin
				Khalaf, who were the bitterest enemies of Islam. This
				shows that the incident took place in the period when
				these chiefs were still on meeting terms with the Holy
				Prophet and their antagonism to Islam had not yet grown
				so strong as to have stopped their paying visits to him
				and having dialogues with him off and on. All these
				arguments indicate that this is one of the very earliest
				Surahs to be revealed at Makkah.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				In view of the apparent style with which the discourse
				opens, one feels that in this Surah Allah has expressed
				His displeasure against the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
				peace) for his treating the blind man with indifference
				and attending to the big chiefs exclusively. But when the
				whole Surah is considered objectively, one finds that the
				displeasure, in fact, has been expressed against the
				disbelieving Quraish, who because of their arrogant
				attitude and indifference to the truth, were rejecting
				with contempt the message of truth being conveyed by the
				Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace). Then, besides teaching
				him the correct method of preaching, the error of the
				method that he was adopting at the start of his mission
				has also been pointed out. His treating the blind man
				with neglect and disregard and devoting all his attention
				to the Quraish chiefs was not for the reason that he
				regarded the rich as noble and a poor blind man as
				contemptible, and, God forbid, there was some rudeness in
				his manner for which Allah reproved him. But, as a matter
				of fact, when a caller to Truth embarks on his mission of
				conveying his message to the people, he naturally wants
				the most influential people of society to accept his
				message so that his task becomes easy, for even if his
				invitation spreads among the poor and weak people, it
				cannot make much difference. Almost the same attitude had
				the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) also adopted in the
				beginning, his motive being only sincerity and a desire
				to promote his mission and not any idea of respect for
				the big people and hatred for the small people. But Allah
				made him realize that that was not the correct method of
				extending invitation to Islam, but from his mission's
				point of view, every man, who was a seeker after truth,
				was important, even if he was weak, or poor, and every
				man, who was heedless to the truth, was unimportant, even
				if he occupied a high position in society. Therefore, he
				should openly proclaim and convey the teachings of Islam
				to all and sundry, but the people who were really worthy
				of his attention, were those who were inclined to accept
				the Truth, and his sublime and noble message was too high
				to be presented before those haughty people who in their
				arrogance and vanity thought that they did not stand in
				need of him but rather he stood in need of them.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is the theme of vv. 1-16. From verse 17 onward the
				rebuke directly turns to the disbelievers, who were
				repudiating the invitation of the Holy Messenger of Allah
				(upon whom be peace). In this, first they have been
				reproved for their attitude which they had adopted
				against their Creator, Providence and Sustainer. In the
				end, they have been warned of the dreadful fate that they
				would meet in consequence of their conduct on the Day of
				Resurrection.

				It is derived from the word kuwwirat in the first verse.

				The subject matter and the style clearly show that it is
				one of the earliest Surahs to be revealed at Makkah.

		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				It has two themes: the Hereafter and the institution of
				Apostleship.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the first six verses the first stage of the
				Resurrection has been mentioned when the sun will lose
				its light, the stars will scatter, the mountains will be
				uprooted and will disperse, the people will become
				heedless of their dearest possessions, the beasts of the
				jungle will be stupefied and will gather together, and
				the seas will boil up. Then in the next seven verses the
				second stage has been described when the souls will be
				reunited with the bodies, the records will be laid open,
				the people will be called to account for their crimes,
				the heavens will be unveiled, and Hell and Heaven will be
				brought into full view. After depicting the Hereafter
				thus, man has been left to ponder his own self and deeds,
				saying: "Then each man shall himself know what he has
				brought with him."
			</p>
			<p>
				After this the theme of Apostleship has been taken up. In
				this the people of Makkah have been addressed, as if to
				say "Whatever Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and
				blessings) is presenting before you, is not the bragging
				of a madman, nor an evil suggestion inspired by Satan,
				but the word of a noble, exalted and trustworthy
				messenger sent by God, whom Muhammad (upon whom be
				Allah's peace and blessings) has seen with his own eyes
				in the bright horizon of the clear sky in broad day
				light. Whither then are you going having turned away from
				this teaching?"

				It is derived from the word infatarat in the first verse.

				This Surah and the Surah At-Takwir closely resemble each
				other in their subject matter. This shows that both were
				sent down in about the same period.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				Its theme is the Hereafter. According to a tradition
				related in Musnad Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Ibn al-Mundhir,
				Tabarani, Hakim and Ibn Marduyah, on the authority of
				Hadrat Abdullah bin Umar, the Holy Messenger (upon whom
				be peace) said: "The one who wants that he should see the
				Resurrection Day as one would see it with one's eyes,
				should read Surah At-Takwir, Surah Al-Infitar and Surah
				Al-Ishiqaq"
			</p>
			<p>
				In this Surah first the Resurrection Day has been
				described and it is said that when it occurs, every
				person will see whatever he has done in the world. After
				this, man has been asked to ponder the question: "O man,
				what has deluded you into thinking that the God, Who
				brought you into being and by Whose favor and bounty you
				possess the finest body, limbs and features among all
				creatures, is only bountiful and not just?His being
				bountiful and generous does not mean that you should
				become fearless of His justice." Then, man has been
				warned, so as to say: "Do not remain involved in any
				misunderstanding. Your complete record is being prepared.
				There are trustworthy writers who are writing down
				whatever you do." In conclusion, it has been forcefully
				stated that the Day of Resurrection will surely take
				place when the righteous shall enjoy every kind of bliss
				in Paradise and the wicked shall be punished in Hell. On
				that day no one shall avail anyone anything. All powers
				of judgment shall be with Allah.

				It is derived from the very first verse; Wayl-ul-lil
				mutaffifin.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				The style of the Surah and its subject matter clearly
				show that it was revealed in the earliest stage at
				Makkah, when surah after surah was being revealed to
				impress the doctrine of the Hereafter on the people's
				minds. This Surah was revealed when they had started
				ridiculing the Muslims and disgracing them publicly in
				the streets and in their assemblies, but persecution and
				manhandling of the Muslims had not yet started. Some
				commentators regard this as a Madani Surah. This
				misunderstanding has been caused by a tradition from Ibn
				Abbas according to which when the Holy Prophet (upon whom
				be peace) arrived in Madinah, the evil of giving short
				weight and measure was widespread among the people there.
				Then Allah sent down Wayl ul-lil mutaffifin and the
				people began to give full weight and measure. But, as we
				have explained in the introduction to Surah Ad-Dahr, the
				common practice with the Companions and their successors
				was that when they found that a verse applied to a
				certain matter of life, they would say that it had been
				sent down concerning that particular matter. Therefore,
				what is proved by the tradition of Ibn Abbas is that when
				after his emigration to Madinah the Holy Prophet (upon
				whom be peace) saw that the evil was widespread among the
				people there, he recited this Surah before them by
				Allah's Command and this helped them mend their ways.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				The theme of this Surah too is the Hereafter. In the
				first six verses the people have been taken to task for
				the prevalent evil practice in their commercial dealings.
				When they had to receive their due from others, they
				demanded that it be given in full, but when they had to
				measure or weigh for others, they would give less than
				what was due. Taking this one evil as an example out of
				countless evils prevalent in society, it has been said
				that it is an inevitable result of the heedlessness of
				the Hereafter. Unless the people realized that one day
				they would have to appear before God and account for each
				single act they performed in the world, it was not
				possible that they would adopt piety and righteousness in
				their daily affairs. Even if a person might practice
				honesty in some of his less important dealings in view of
				"honesty is the best policy", he would never practice
				honesty on occasions when dishonesty would seem to be
				"the best policy". Man can develop true and enduring
				honesty only when he fears God and sincerely believes in
				the Hereafter, for then he would regard honesty not
				merely as "a policy" but as "a duty" and obligation, and
				his being constant in it, or otherwise, would not be
				dependent on its being useful or useless in the world.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thus, after making explicit the relation between morality
				and the doctrine of the Hereafter in an effective and
				impressive way, in vv. 7-17, it has been said: The deeds
				of the wicked are already being recorded in the black
				list of the culprits, and in the Hereafter they will meet
				with utter ruin. Then in vv. 18-28, the best end of the
				virtuous has been described and it has been laid that
				their deeds are being recorded in the list of the exalted
				people, on which are appointed the angels nearest to
				Allah.
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, the believers have been consoled, and the
				disbelievers warned, as if to say: "The people who are
				disgracing and humiliating the believers today, are
				culprits who, on the Resurrection Day, will meet with a
				most evil end in consequence of their conduct, and these
				very believers will feel comforted when they see their
				fate."

	<sura num="84">
		<section heading="Name">
			<p>
				It is derived from the word inshaqqat in the first verse.
				Inshaqqat is infinitive which means to split asunder,
				thereby implying that it is the Surah in which mention
				has been made of the splitting asunder of the heavens.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				This too is one of the earliest Surahs to be revealed at
				Makkah. The internal evidence of its subject matter
				indicates that persecution of the Muslims had not yet
				started; however, the message of the Quran was being
				openly repudiated at Makkah and the people were refusing
				to acknowledge that Resurrection would ever take place
				when they would have to appear before their God to render
				an account of their deeds.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				Its theme is the Resurrection and Hereafter. In the first
				five verses not only have the state of Resurrection been
				described vividly but an argument of its being true and
				certain also have been given. It has been stated that the
				heavens on that Day will split asunder, the earth will be
				spread out plain and smooth, and it will throw out
				whatever lies inside it of the dead bodies of men and
				evidences of their deeds so as to become completely empty
				from within. The argument given for it is that such will
				be the Command of their Lord for the heavens and the
				earth; since both are His creation. they cannot dare
				disobey His Command. For them the only right and proper
				course is that they should obey the Command of their
				Lord.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, in vv. 6-19 it has been said that whether man is
				conscious of this fact or not, he in any case is moving
				willy nilly to the destination when he will appear and
				stand before his Lord. At that time all human beings will
				divide into two parts: first those whose records will be
				given in their right hands: they will be forgiven without
				any severe reckoning; second those whose records will be
				given them behind their back. They will wish that they
				should die somehow, but they will not die; instead they
				will be cast into Hell. They will meet with this fate
				because in the world they remained lost in the
				misunderstanding that they would never have to appear
				before God to render an account of their deeds, whereas
				their Lord was watching whatever they were doing, and
				there was no reason why they should escape the
				accountability for their deeds. Their moving gradually
				from the life of the world to the meting out of rewards
				and punishments in the Hereafter was as certain as the
				appearance of twilight after sunset, the coming of the
				night after the day, the returning of men and animals to
				their respective abodes at night, and the growing of the
				crescent into full moon.
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, the disbelievers who repudiate the Quran
				instead of bowing down to God when they hear it, have
				been forewarned of a grievous punishment and the good
				news of limitless rewards has been given to the believers
				and the righteous.
			</p>
		</section>

			<p>
				The Surah is so designated after the word al buruj
				appearing in the first verse.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				The subject matter itself indicates that this Surah was
				sent down at Makkah in the period when persecution of the
				Muslims was at its climax and the disbelievers of Makkah
				were trying their utmost by tyranny and coercion to turn
				away the new converts from Islam.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				Its theme is to warn the disbelievers of the evil
				consequences of the persecution and tyranny that they
				were perpetrating on the converts to Islam, and to
				console the believers, so as to say: "If you remain firm
				and steadfast against tyranny and coercion, you will be
				rewarded richly for it, and Allah will certainly avenge
				Himself on your persecutors on your behalf"
			</p>
			<p>
				In this connection, first of all the story of the people
				of the ditch (ashab al-ukhdud) had been related, who had
				burnt the believers to death by casting them into pits
				full of fire. By means of this story the believers and
				the disbelievers have been taught a few lessons. First,
				that just as the people of the ditch became worthy of
				Allah's curse and punishment, so are the chiefs of Makkah
				also becoming worthy of it. Second, that just as the
				believers at that time had willingly accepted to
				sacrifice their lives by being burnt to death in the pits
				of fire instead of turning away from the faith, so also
				the believers now should endure every persecution but
				should never give up the faith. Third, that God,
				acknowledging Whom displeases the disbelievers and is
				urged on by the believers, is Dominant and Master of the
				Kingdom of the earth and heavens; He is self-praiseworthy
				and is watching what the two groups are striving for.
				Therefore, it is certain that the disbelievers will not
				only be punished in Hell for their disbelief but, more
				than that, they too will suffer punishment by fire as a
				fit recompense for their tyranny and cruelties. Likewise,
				this also is certain that those, who believe and follow
				up their belief with good deeds, should go to Paradise
				and this indeed is the supreme success. Then the
				disbelievers have been warned, so as to say: "God's grip
				is very severe. If you are proud of the strength of your
				hosts, you should know that the hosts of Pharaoh and
				Thamud were even stronger and more numerous. Therefore,
				you should learn a lesson from the fate they met. God's
				power has so encompassed you that you cannot escape His
				encirclement, and the Quran that you are bent upon
				belying, is unchangeable: it is inscribed in the
				Preserved Tablet, which cannot be corrupted in any way."

				The Surah taken its name from the word at-tariq in its
				first verse.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				The style of its subject matter resembles that of the
				earliest Surahs revealed at Makkah, but this surah was
				sent down at a stage when the disbelievers of Makkah were
				employing all sorts of devices and plans to defeat and
				frustrate the message of the Quran and Muhammad (upon
				whom be Allah's peace and blessings).
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				It discuses two themes: first that man has to appear
				before God after death; second, that the Quran is a
				decisive Word which no plan or device of the disbelievers
				can defeat or frustrate.
			</p>
			<p>
				First of all, the stars of the heavens have been cited as
				an evidence that there is nothing in the universe which
				may continue to exist and survive without guardian over
				it. Then man has been asked to consider his own self as
				to how he has been brought into existence from a mere
				sperm drop and shaped into a living human being. Then it
				has been said that the God, Who has so brought him into
				existence, has certainly the power to create him once
				again, and this resurrection will be for the purpose to
				subject to scrutiny all the secrets of man which remained
				hidden in the world. At that time, man will neither be
				able to escape the consequences of his deeds by his own
				power, nor will anyone else come to his rescue.
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, it has been pointed out that just as the
				falling of rain from the sky and the sprouting of plants
				and crops from the earth is no child's play but a serious
				task, so also the truths expressed in the Quran are no
				jest but a firm and unchangeable reality. The
				disbelievers are involved in the misunderstanding that
				their plans and devices will defeat the invitation of the
				Quran, but they do not know that Allah too is devising a
				plan which will bring to nought all their scheming and
				planning. Then in one sentence the discourse has been
				summed up, with a word of consolation to the Holy Prophet
				(upon whom be peace) and a tacit warning to the
				disbelievers, saying: "Have patience for a while: let the
				disbelievers do their worst. Before long they will
				themselves realize whether they have been able to defeat
				the Quran by their scheming or the Quran has dominated
				them in the very place where they are exerting their
				utmost to defeat it."

				The Surah takes its name from the word al-A'la in the
				very first verse.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				The subject matter shows that this too is one of the
				earliest Surahs to be revealed, and the words: "We shall
				enable you to recite, then you shall never forget" of
				verse 6 also indicate that it was sent down in the period
				when the Holy Messenger (upon whom he Allah's peace) was
				not yet fully accustomed to receive Revelation and at the
				time Revelation came down he feared lest he should forget
				its words. If this verse is read along with verse 114 of
				Surah Ta Ha and verses 16-19 of Al-Qiyamah and the three
				verses are also considered with regard to their styles
				and contexts, the sequence of events seems to be that
				first in this Surah the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
				was reassured to the effect: "Do not at all worry: We
				shall enable you to recite this Word, then you shall not
				forget it." Then after a lapse of time, on another
				occasion, when the Surah Al-Qiyamah was being revealed,
				the Holy Prophet involuntarily began to rehearse the
				words of the Revelation. Thereupon it was said: "O
				Prophet do not move your tongue to remember this
				Revelation hastily. It is for Us to have it remembered
				and read. Therefore when We are reciting it, listen to
				its recital carefully. Again, it is for Us to explain its
				meaning." Last of all, on the occasion of the revelation
				of Surah Ta Ha, the Holy Prophet on account of human
				weakness, again became afraid lest his memory should fail
				to preserve some portion of the 113 verses which were
				continuously revealed at that time, and therefore, he
				began to memorize them. Thereupon, it was said: "And see
				that you do not hasten to recite the Quran before its
				revelation is completed to you." After this, it never so
				happened that he felt any such danger, for apart form
				these three places, there is no other place in the Quran
				where there might be a reference to this matter.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				This short surah contains three themes.Tauhid,
				instructions to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) and
				the Hereafter.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the first verse, the doctrine of Tauhid has been
				compressed into a single sentence, saying that Allah's
				name should be glorified and exalted, i.e. He should not
				be remembered by any name which mighty reflect a
				deficiency, fault, weakness, or an aspect of likeness,
				with created beings, for the root of all false creeds in
				the world are wrong concepts about Allah, which assumed
				the form of an erroneous name for His glorious and
				exalted Being. Therefore, for the correction of the
				creed, the primary thing is that Allah Almighty should be
				remembered only by the beautiful names which suit and
				befit Him.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the next three verses, it has been said: "Your Lord,
				glorification of Whose name is being enjoined, is He Who
				created everything in the Universe, proportioned it, set
				it a destiny, taught it to perform the function for which
				it is created, and you witness this manifestation of His
				power day and night that He creates vegetation on the
				earth as well as reduces it to mere rubbish. No other
				being has the power to bring about spring nor the power
				to prevent autumn."
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, in the following two verses, the Holy Prophet (upon
				whom be peace) his been consoled, as if to say: "Do not
				worry as to how you will remember word for word the Quran
				that is being revealed to you. It is for Us to preserve
				it in your memory, and its preservation is not in any way
				the result of any excellence in you but the result of Our
				bounty and favor, otherwise if We so will, We can cause
				you to forget it."
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) has been
				told: "You have not been made responsible to bring
				everyone on to the right path; your only duty is to
				convey the truth, and the simplest way of conveying the
				truth is that admonition be given to him who is inclined
				to listen to the admonition and accept it, and the one
				who is not inclined to it, should not be pursued. The one
				who fears the evil consequences of deviation and
				falsehood, will listen to the truth and accept it, and
				the wretched one who avoids listening to and accepting
				it, will himself see his evil end."
			</p>
			<p>
				The discourse has been summed up, saying: "Success is
				only for those who adopt purity of belief, morals and
				deed, and remember the name of their Lord and perform the
				Prayer. But, on the contrary, the people are wholly lost
				in seeking the ease, benefits and pleasures of the world,
				whereas they should actually endeavor for their well
				being in the Hereafter, for the world is transitory and
				the Hereafter everlasting and the blessings of the
				Hereafter are far better than the blessings of the world.
				This truth has not been expressed only in the Quran but
				in the books of the Prophets Abraham and Moses too, it
				had been brought to the notice of man.

		</section>
	</sura>
	<sura num="88">
		<section heading="Name">
			<p>
				The Surah takes its name from the word al-ghishiyah in
				the first verse.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				The whole subject matter of the Surah indicates that this
				too is one of the earliest Surahs to be revealed; but
				this was the period when the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
				peace) had started preaching his message publicly, and
				the people of Makkah were hearing it and ignoring it
				carelessly and thoughtlessly.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				To understand the subject matter well one should keep in
				view the fact that in the initial stage the preaching of
				the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) mostly centered
				around two points which he wanted to instill in the
				people's minds: Tauhid and the Hereafter: and the people
				of Makkah were repudiating both. Let us now consider the
				subject matter and the style of this Surah.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the outset, in order to arouse the people from their
				heedlessness, they have been plainly asked:"Do you have
				any knowledge of the time when an overwhelming calamity
				will descend?" Immediately after this details of the
				impending calamity are given as to how the people will be
				divided into two separate groups and will meet separate
				ends. One group of the people will go to Hell and they
				will suffer punishment; the second group will go to the
				sublime Paradise and will be provided with blessings.
			</p>
			<p>
				After thus arousing the people the theme suddenly changes
				and the question is asked: Do not these people, who frown
				and scorn the teaching of Tauhid and the news of the
				Hereafter being given by the Quran, observe the common
				things which they experience daily in their lives? Do
				they never consider how the camels, on whom their whole
				life activity in the Arabian desert depends, came into
				being, endowed precisely with the same characteristics as
				were required for the beast needed in their desert life?
				When they go on their journeys, they see the sky, the
				mountains, or the earth. Let them ponder over these three
				phenomena and consider as to how the sky was stretched
				above them, how the mountains were erected and how the
				earth was spread beneath them? Has all this come about
				without the skill and craftsmanship of an All-Powerful,
				All Wise Designer? If they acknowledge that a Creator has
				created all this with great wisdom and power and that no
				one else is an associate with Him in their creation, why
				then do they refuse to accept Him alone as their Lord and
				Sustainer? And if they acknowledge that that God had the
				power to create all this, then on what rational ground do
				they hesitate to acknowledge that that God also has the
				power to bring about Resurrection, to recreate man, and
				to make Hell and Heaven?
			</p>
			<p>
				After making the truth plain by this concise and rational
				argument, the address turns from the disbelievers to the
				Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) and he is told: "If
				these people do not acknowledge the truth, they may not;
				you have not been empowered to act with authority over
				them, so that you should coerce them into believing: your
				only task is to exhort, so exhort them. Ultimately they
				have to return to Us; then We shall call them to full
				account and shall inflict a heavy punishment on those who
				do not believe."
			</p>
		</section>
	</sura>
	<sura num="89">
		<section heading="Name">
			<p>
				The Surah is so designated after the word wal-fajr with
				which it opens.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				Its contents show that it was revealed at the stage when
				persecution of the new converts to Islam had begun in
				Makkah. On that very basis the people of Makkah have been
				warned of the evil end of the tribes of Ad and Thamud and
				of Pharaoh.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				Its theme is to affirm the meting out of rewards and
				punishments in the Hereafter, which the people of Makkah
				were not prepared to acknowledge. Let us consider the
				reasoning in the order in which it has been presented.
			</p>
			<p>
				First of all, swearing oaths by the dawn, the ten nights,
				the even and the odd, and the departing night, the
				listeners have been asked: "Are these things not enough
				to testify to the truth of that which you are refusing to
				acknowledge?" From the explanation that we have given of
				these four things in the corresponding notes, it will
				become clear that these things are a symbol of the
				regularity that exists in the night and day, and swearing
				oaths by these the question has been asked in the sense:
				Even after witnessing this wise system established by
				God, do you still need any other evidence to show that it
				is not beyond the power of that God Who has brought about
				this system to establish the Hereafter, and that it is
				the very requirement of his wisdom that He should call
				man to account for his deeds?
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, reasoning from man's own history, the evil end of
				the Ad and the Thamud and Pharaoh has been cited as an
				example to show that when they transgressed all limits
				and multiplied corruption in the earth, Allah laid upon
				them the scourge of His chastisement. This is a proof of
				the fact that the system of the universe is not being run
				by deaf and blind forces, nor is the world a lawless
				kingdom of a corrupt ruler, but a Wise Ruler is ruling
				over it, the demand of Whose wisdom and justice is
				continuously visible in the world itself in man's own
				history that He should call to account, and reward and
				punish accordingly, the being whom He has blessed with
				reason and moral sense and given the right of
				appropriation in the world.
			</p>
			<p>
				After this, an appraisal has been made of the general
				moral state of human society of which Arab paganism was a
				conspicuous example; two aspects of it in particular,
				have been criticized: first the materialistic attitude of
				the people on account of which overlooking the moral good
				and evil, they regarded only the achievement of worldly
				wealth, rank and position, or the absence of it, as the
				criterion of honor or disgrace, and had forgotten that
				neither riches was a reward nor poverty a punishment, but
				that Allah is trying man in both conditions to see what
				attitude he adopts when blessed with wealth and how he
				behaves when afflicted by poverty. Second, the people's
				attitude under which the orphan child in their society
				was left destitute on the death of the father. Nobody
				asked after the poor; whoever could, usurped the whole
				heritage left by the deceased parent, and drove away the
				weak heirs fraudulently. The people were so afflicted
				with an insatiable greed for wealth that they were never
				satisfied however much they might hoard and amass. This
				criticism is meant to make them realize as to why the
				people with such an attitude and conduct in the life of
				the world should not be called to account for their
				misdeeds.
			</p>
			<p>
				The discourse has been concluded with the assertion that
				accountability shall certainly be held and it will be
				held on the Day when the Divine Court will be
				established. At that time the deniers of the judgment
				will understand that which they are not understanding now
				in spite of instruction and admonition, but understanding
				then will be of no avail. The denier will regret and say,
				"Would that I had provided for this Day beforehand while
				I lived in the world." But his regrets will not save him
				from Allah's punishment. However, as for the people who
				would have accepted the Truth, which the heavenly books
				and the Prophets of God were presenting, with full
				satisfaction of the heart in the world, Allah will be
				pleased with them and they will be well pleased with the
				rewards bestowed by Allah. They will be called upon to
				join the righteous and enter Paradise.

	<sura num="90">
		<section heading="Name">
			<p>
				The Surah has been so named after the word al balad in
				the first verse.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				Its subject matter and style resemble those of the
				earliest Surahs revealed at Makkah, but it contains a
				pointer which indicates that it was sent down in the
				period when the disbelievers of Makkah had resolved to
				oppose the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace), and
				made it lawful for themselves to commit tyranny and
				excess against him.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				In this Surah a vast subject has been compressed into a
				few brief sentences, and it is a miracle of the Quran
				that a complete ideology of life which could hardly be
				explained in a thick volume has been abridged most
				effectively in brief sentences of this short Surah. Its
				theme is to explain the true position of man in the world
				and of the world in relation to man and to tell that God
				has shown to man both the highways of good and evil, has
				also provided for him the means to judge and see and
				follow them, and now it rests upon man's own effort and
				judgment whether he chooses the path of virtue and
				reaches felicity or adopts the path of vice and meets
				with doom.
			</p>
			<p>
				First, the city of Makkah and the hardships being faced
				therein by the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) and the
				state of the children of Adam have been cited as a
				witness to the truth that this world is not a place of
				rest and ease for man, where he might have been born to
				enjoy life, but here he has been created into toil and
				struggle. If this theme is read with verse 39 of Surah
				An-Najm (Laisa lil insani illa ma saa: there is nothing
				for man but what he has striven for), it becomes plain
				that in this world the future of man depends on his toil
				and struggle, effort and striving.
			</p>
			<p>
				After this, man's misunderstanding that he is all in all
				in this world and that there is no superior power to
				watch what he does and to call him to account, has been
				refuted.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, taking one of the many moral concepts of ignorance
				held by man, as an example, it has been pointed out what
				wrong criteria of merit and greatness he has proposed for
				himself in the world. The person who for ostentation and
				display squanders heaps of wealth, not only himself
				prides upon his extravagances but the people also admire
				him for it enthusiastically, whereas the Being Who is
				watching over his deeds, sees by what methods he obtained
				the wealth and in what ways and with what motives and
				intention he spent it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then Allah says: We have given man the means of knowledge
				and the faculties of thinking and understanding and
				opened up before him both the highways of virtue and
				vice: one way leads down to moral depravity, and it is an
				easy way pleasing for the self; the other way leads up to
				moral heights, which is steep like an uphill road, for
				scaling which man has to exercise self- restraint. It is
				man's weakness that he prefers slipping down into the
				abyss to scaling the cliff.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, Allah has explained what the steep road is by
				following which man can ascend to the heights. It is that
				he should give up spending for ostentation, display and
				pride and should spend his wealth to help the orphans and
				the needy, should believe in Allah and His Religion and
				joining the company of believers should participate in
				the construction of a society which should fulfill the
				demands of virtue and righteousness patiently and should
				be compassionate to the people. The end of those who
				follow this way is that they would become worthy of
				Allah's mercies. On the contrary, the end of those who
				follow the wrong way, is the fire of Hell from which
				there is no escape.

		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				The subject matter and the style show that this Surah too
				was revealed in the earliest period at Makkah at a stage
				when opposition to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's
				peace) had grown very strong and intense.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				Its theme is to distinguish the good from the evil and to
				warn the people, who were refusing to understand this
				distinction and insisting on following the evil way, of
				the evil end.
			</p>
			<p>
				In view of the subject matter this Surah consists of two
				parts. The first part consists of vv. 1-10, and the
				second of vv. 11-15. The first part deals with three
				things: 
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					That just as the sun and the moon, the day and
					the night, the earth and the sky, are different
					from each other and contradictory in their
					effects and results, so are the good and the evil
					different from each other and contradictory in
					their effects and results; they are neither alike
					in their outward appearance nor can they be alike
					in their results.
				</li>
				<li>
					That Allah after giving the human self powers of
					the body, sense and mind has not left it
					uninformed in the world, but has instilled into
					his unconscious by means of a natural inspiration
					the distinction between good and evil, right and
					wrong, and the sense of the good to be good and
					of the evil to be evil.
				</li>
				<li>
					That the future of man depends on how by using
					the powers of discrimination, will and judgment
					that Allah has endowed him with, he develops the
					good and suppresses the evil tendencies of the
					self. If he develops the good inclination and
					frees his self of the evil inclinations, he will
					attain to eternal success, and if, on the
					contrary, he suppresses the good and promotes the
					evil, he will meet with disappointment and
					failure.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				In the second part, citing the historical precedent of
				the people of Thamud, the significance of Apostleship has
				been brought out. A Messenger is raised in the world,
				because the inspirational knowledge of good and evil that
				Allah has placed in human nature is by itself not enough
				for the guidance of man, but on account of his failure to
				understand it fully man has been proposing wrong criteria
				and theories of good and evil and thus going astray. That
				is why Allah sent down clear and definite Revelation to
				the Prophets (peace be upon them) to augment man's
				natural inspiration so that they may expound to the
				people as to what is good and what is evil. Likewise, the
				Prophet Salih (peace be upon him) was sent to the people
				of Thamud, but the people overwhelmed by the evil of
				their self, had become so rebellious that they rejected
				him. And when he presented before them the miracle of the
				she camel, as demanded by themselves, the most wretched
				one of them, in spite of his warning, hamstrung it, in
				accordance with the will and desire of the people.
				Consequently, the entire tribe was overtaken by a
				disaster.
			</p>
			<p>
				While narrating this story of the Thamud nowhere in the
				Surah has it been said "O people of Quraish, if you
				rejected your Prophet, Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's
				peace and blessings), as the Thamud had rejected theirs,
				you too would meet with the same fate as they met."The
				conditions at that time in Makkah were similar to those
				that had been created by the wicked among the people of
				Thamud against the Prophet Salih (peace be upon him).
				Therefore, the narration of this story in those
				conditions was by itself enough to suggest to the people
				of Makkah how precisely this historical precedent applied
				to them.

				The Surah takes its name from the word wal-lail with

		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				Its subject matter so closely resembles that of Surah
				Ash-Shams that each Surah seems to be an explanation of
				the other. It is one and the same thing which has been
				explained in Surah Ash-Shams in one way and in this Surah
				in another. This indicates that both these Surahs were
				sent down in about the same period.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				Its theme is to distinguish between the two different
				ways of life and to explain the contrast between their
				ultimate ends and results. In view of the subject matter
				this Surah consists of two parts, the first part
				consisting of vv. 1-11 and the second of vv. 12-21.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the first part, at the outset it has been pointed out
				that the strivings and doings that the individuals,
				nations and groups of mankind are engaged in in the
				world, are, in respect of their moral nature, as
				divergent as the day is from the night, and the male from
				the female. After this, according to the general style of
				the brief Surahs of the Quran, three moral
				characteristics of one kind and three moral
				characteristics of the other kind have been presented as
				an illustration from among a vast collection of the
				strivings and activities of man, from which every man can
				judge which style of life is represented by one kind of
				the characteristics and which style of life by the other
				kind. Both these styles have been described in such
				brief, elegant, and pithy sentences that they move the
				heart and go down into memory as soon as one hears them.
				Characteristics of the first kind are that one should
				spend one's wealth, adopt God-consciousness and piety,
				and acknowledge the good as good. The second kind of the
				characteristics are that one should be miserly, should
				least care for God's pleasure and His displeasure, and
				should repudiate what is good and right. Then it has been
				stated that these two modes of action which are clearly
				divergent, cannot be equal and alike in respect of their
				results. But, just as they are divergent in their nature,
				so they are divergent in their results. The person (or
				group of persons) who adopts the first mode of action,
				Allah will make easy for him the correct way of life, so
				much so that doing good will become easy for him and
				doing evil difficult. On the contrary, he who adopts the
				second mode of life, Allah will make easy for him the
				difficult and hard way of life, so much so that doing
				evil will become easy for him and doing good difficult.
				This passage has been concluded with a most effective and
				touching sentence, saying: "This worldly wealth for the
				sake of which man is even prepared to risk his life: will
				not go down with him into the grave; therefore, what will
				it avail him after death?"'
			</p>
			<p>
				In the second part also three truths have been stated
				equally briefly. First, that Allah has not left man
				uninformed in the examination hall of the world, but He
				has taken on Himself the responsibility to tell him which
				one is the straight and right way out of the different
				ways of life. Here, there was no need to point out that
				by sending His Messenger and His Book. He has fulfilled
				His responsibility, for both the Messenger and the Book
				were present to afford the guidance. Second, that the
				Master of both the world and the Hereafter is Allah
				alone. If you seek the world, it is He Who will give it,
				and if you seek the Hereafter, again it is He Who will
				give it. Now, it is for you to decide what you should
				seek from Him. The third truth that has been stated is
				that the wretched one who rejects the good, which is
				being presented through the Messenger and the Book, and
				turns away from it, will have a blazing fire ready for
				him. As for the God fearing person who spends his wealth
				in a good cause, without any selfish motive, only for the
				sake of winning his Lord's good pleasure, his Lord will
				be pleased with him and will bless him with so much that
				he will be well pleased with Him.

			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				Its subject matter clearly indicates that it belongs to
				the earliest period at Makkah. Traditions also show that
				the revelations were suspended for a time, which caused
				the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) to be
				deeply distressed and grieved. On this account he felt
				very anxious that perhaps he had committed some error
				because of which his Lord had become angry with him and
				had forsaken him. Thereupon he was given the consolation
				that revelation had not been stopped because of some
				displeasure but this was necessitated by the same
				expediency as underlies the peace and stillness of the
				night after the bright day, as if to say: "If you had
				continuously been exposed to the intensely bright light
				of Revelation (Wahi) your nerves could not have endured
				it. Therefore, an interval was given in order to afford
				you peace and tranquillity." This state was experienced
				by the Holy Prophet in the initial stage of the
				Prophethood when he was not yet accustomed to hear the
				intensity of Revelation. On this basis, observance of a
				pause in between was necessary. This we have already
				explained in the introduction to Surah Al Muddaththir;
				and in E. N. 5 of Surah Al-Muzzammil also we have
				explained what great burden of the coming down of
				Revelation he had to bear. Later, when the Holy Prophet
				developed the power to bear this burden, there was no
				longer any need for long gaps.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				Its theme is to console the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
				peace) and its object to remove his anxiety and distress,
				which he had been caused by the suspension of Revelation.
				First of all, swearing an oath by the bright morning and
				the stillness of night, he has been reassured, so as to
				say: "Your Lord has not at all forsaken you, nor is he
				displeased with you." Then, he has been given the good
				news that the hardships that he was experiencing in the
				initial stage of his mission, would not last long, for
				every later period of life for him would be better than
				the former period, and before long Allah would bless him
				so abundantly that he would be well pleased. This is one
				of the express prophecies of the Quran, which proved
				literally true, afterwards, whereas when this prophecy
				was made there seemed not to be the remotest chance that
				the helpless and powerless man who had come out to wage a
				war against the ignorance and paganism of the entire
				nation, would ever achieve such wonderful success.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, addressing His Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
				Allah says:"O My dear Prophet, what has caused you the
				anxiety and distress that your Lord has forsaken you, and
				that We are displeased with you? Whereas the fact is that
				We have been good to you with kindness after kindness
				ever since the day of your birth. You were born an
				orphan, We made the best arrangement for your upbringing
				and care: you were unaware of the Way, We showed you the
				Way; you were indigent, We made you rich. All this shows
				that you have been favored by Us from the very beginning
				and Our grace and bounty has been constantly focused on
				you." Here, one should also keep in view vv. 37-42 of
				Surah Ta Ha, where Allah, while sending the Prophet Moses
				to confront a tyrant like Pharaoh, encouraged and
				consoled him, saying: "We have been looking after you
				with kindness ever since your birth; therefore, you
				should be satisfied that you will not be left alone in
				this dreadful mission. Our bounty will constantly be with
				you."
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, Allah has instructed His Prophet (upon
				whom be peace) telling him how he should treat the
				creatures of God to repay for the favors He has done him
				and how he should render thanks for the blessings He has
				bestowed on him.

		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				Its subject matter so closely resembles that of Surah
				Ad-Duha that both these Surah seem to have been revealed
				in about the same period under similar conditions.
				According to Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas, it was sent down
				in Makkah just after wad-Duha.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				The aim and object of this Surah too is to console and
				encourage the Holy Messenger (upon whom be Allah's
				peace). Before his call he never had to encounter the
				conditions which he suddenly had to encounter after it
				when he embarked on his mission of inviting the people to
				Islam. This was by itself a great revolution in his own
				life of which he had no idea in his life before
				Prophethood. No sooner had he started preaching the
				message of Islam than the same society which had esteemed
				him with unique honor, turned hostile to him. The same
				relatives and friends, the same clansmen and neighbors,
				who used to treat him with the highest respect, began to
				shower him with abuse and invective. No one in Makkah was
				prepared to listen to him; he began to be ridiculed and
				mocked in the street and on the road; and at every step
				he had to face new difficulties. Although gradually he
				became accustomed to the hardships, even much severer
				ones, yet the initial stage was very discouraging for
				him. That is why first Surah Ad-Duha was sent down to
				console him, and then this Surah.
			</p>
			<p>
				In it, at the outset, Allah says: "We have favored you, O
				Prophet, with three great blessings; therefore you have
				no cause to be disheartened. The first is the blessing of
				Sharh Sadr (opening up of the breast), the second of
				removing from you the heavy burden that was weighing down
				your back before the call, and the third of exalting your
				renown the like of which has never been granted to any
				man before. Further below in the notes we have explained
				what is implied by each of these blessings and how great
				and unique these blessings indeed are!
			</p>
			<p>
				After this, the Lord and Sustainer of the universe has
				reassured His Servant and Messenger (upon whom be peace)
				that the period of hardships which he is passing through,
				is not very long, but following close behind it there is
				also a period of ease. This same thing has been described
				in Surah Ad-Duha, saying: "Every later period is better
				for you than the former period, and soon your Lord will
				give you so much that you will be well pleased."
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, the Holy Prophet has been instructed, so
				as to say, "You can develop the power to bear and resist
				the hardships of the initial stage only by one means, and
				it is this: `When you are free from your occupations, you
				should devote yourself to the labour and toil of worship,
				and turn all your attention exclusively to your Lord'."
				This same instruction has been given him in much greater
				detail in Surah Al-Muzzammil 1-9.

				The Surah has been so named after the very First word
				at-tin.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				According to Qatadah, this Surah is Madani. Two different
				views have been reported from lbn Abbas: first that it is
				a Makki Surah, and second that it is Madani. But the
				majority of scholars regard it as a Makki revelation, a
				manifest symbol of which is the use of the words
				hadh-al-balad-il-amin (this city of peace) for Makkah.
				Obviously, if it had been revealed at Madinah, it would
				not be correct to use the words "this city" for Makkah.
				Besides, a study of the contents of the Surah shows that
				it belongs to the earliest period of Makkah, for in it
				there is no sign whatever to indicate that during the
				period of its revelation any conflict had started between
				Islam and unbelief. Moreover, it reflects the same style
				of the earliest revelations of Makkah period in which
				briefly and succinctly the people have been made to
				realize that the judgment of the Hereafter is necessary
				and absolutely rational.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				Its theme is the rewards and punishments of the
				Hereafter. For this purpose first swearing an oath by the
				habitats of some illustrious Prophets, it has been stated
				that Allah has created man in the most excellent of
				molds. Although at other places in the Quran, this truth
				has been expressed in different ways, for example, at
				some places it has been said: "Allah appointed man His
				vicegerent on the earth and commanded the angels to bow
				down to him (Al-Baqara: 30,34, Al-Anam: 165, Al-Araf: 11,
				Al-Hijr 28,29, An-Naml: 62, Suad 71- 73);" at others
				that: "Man has become bearer of the Divine trust, which
				the earth and the heavens and the mountains did not have
				the power to bear (Al-Ahzab 72);" and at still others
				that: "We honored the children of Adam and exalted them
				above many of Our other creatures (Banl Israel 70)," yet
				here the statement made on oath in particular by the
				habitats of the Prophets that man has been created in the
				finest of molds, signifies that mankind has been blessed
				with such an excellent mould and nature that it gave
				birth to men capable of attaining to the highest position
				of Prophethood, a higher position than which has not been
				attained by any other creature of God.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, it has been stated that there are two kinds of
				men:. those who in spite of having been created in the
				finest of mould, become inclined to evil and their moral
				degeneration causes them to be reduced to the lowest of
				the low, and those who by adopting the way of faith and
				righteousness remain secure from the degeneration and
				consistent with the noble position, which is the
				necessary demand of their having been created in the best
				of molds. The existence among mankind of both these kinds
				of men is such a factual thing which no one can deny, for
				it is being observed and experienced in society
				everywhere at all times.
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, this factual reality has been used as an
				argument to prove that when among the people there are
				these two separate and quite distinct kinds, how can one
				deny the judgment and retribution for deeds? If the
				morally degraded are not punished and the morally pure
				and exalted are not rewarded and both end in the dust
				alike, it would mean that there is no justice in the
				Kingdom of God; whereas human nature and common sense
				demand that a judge should do justice. How then can one
				conceive that Allah, Who is the most just of all judges,
				would not do justice?

				The Surah is so entitled after the word alaq in the
				second verse.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				This Surah has two parts: the first part consists of vv.
				1-5, and the second of vv. 6-19. About the first part a
				great majority of the Islamic scholars are agreed that it
				forms the very first Revelation to be sent down to the
				Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings).
				In this regard, the Hadith from Hadrat Aishah, which Imam
				Ahmad, Bukhari, Muslim, and other traditionists have
				related with several chains of authorities, is one of the
				most authentic hadith on the subject. In it Hadrat Aishah
				has narrated the full story of the beginning of
				revelation as she herself heard it from the Holy
				Messenger of Allah. Besides, Ibn Abbas, Abu Musa
				al-Ashari and a group of the Companions also are reported
				to have stated that these were the very first verses of
				the Quran to be revealed to the Holy Prophet. The second
				part was sent down afterwards when the Holy Prophet (upon
				whom be peace) began to perform the prescribed Prayer in
				the precincts of the Kabah and Abu Jahl tried to prevent
				him from this with threats.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Beginning of Revelation">
			<p>
				The traditionists have related on the strength of their
				respective authorities the story of the beginning of
				revelation from Iman Az-Zuhri, who had it from Hadrat
				Urwah bin Zubair, who had it from Hadrat Aishah, his
				aunt. She states that revelations to the Holy Prophet
				(upon whom be peace) began in the form of true (according
				to other traditions, good) visions. Whichever vision he
				saw it seemed as though he saw it in broad daylight.
				Afterwards solitude became dear to him and he would go to
				the Cave of Hira to engage in worship there for several
				days and nights (Hadrat Aishah has used the word
				tahannuth, which Imam Zuhri has explained as ta'abbud:
				devotional exercises. This was some kind of worship which
				he performed, for until then he had not been taught the
				method of performing the Prayer by Allah). He would take
				provisions with him and stay there for several days, then
				would return to Hadrat Khadijah who would again provide
				for him for a few more days. One day when he was in the
				Cave of Hira, Revelation came down to him unexpectedly
				and the Angel said, to him: "Read". After this Hadrat
				Aishah reports the words of the Holy Prophet himself, to
				the effect, "I said: I cannot read! Thereupon the Angel
				took me and pressed me until I could bear it no more.
				Then he left me and said: Read. I said: I cannot read! He
				pressed me a second time until I could bear it no more.
				Then he left me and said: Read. I again said: I cannot
				read! He pressed me for the third time until I could bear
				it no more. Then he left me and said: Iqra bismi Rabbi
				kal- ladhi khalaqa: (Read in the name of your Lord Who
				created) till he reached ma lam ya lam (what he did not
				know)." Hadrat Aishah says: "Then the Holy Messenger
				(upon whom be peace) returned home to Hadrat Khadijah
				trembling with fear, and said to her: `Cover me, cover
				me', and he was covered. When terror left him, he said:
				`O Khadijah, what has happened to me?' Then he narrated
				to her whatever had happened, and said: `I fear for my
				life'. She said; `No never! Be of good cheer. By God,
				never will God debase you: you treat the kindred well,
				you speak the truth, (one tradition adds: you restore
				what is entrusted to you), you bear the burden of the
				helpless, you help the poor, you entertain the guests,
				and you cooperate in good works.' Then she took him to
				Waraqah bin Naufal, who was her cousin. He had become a
				Christian in pre-Islamic days, wrote the Gospel in Arabic
				and Hebrew, and had become very old and blind. Hadrat
				Khadijah said: `Brother, listen to the son of your
				brother.' Waraqah said to the Holy Prophet: `What have
				you seen, nephew?' The Holy Prophet described what he had
				seen. Waraqah said; `This is the same Namus (the Angel of
				Revelation) which Allah had sent down to Moses. Would
				that I were a young man during your Prophethood! Would
				that I were alive when your tribe would expel you!' The
				Holy Prophet said: `Will they expel me?' Waraqah said;
				`Yes, never has it so happened that a person brought what
				you have brought and was not treated as an enemy. If I
				live till then I would help you with all the power at my
				command.' But not very long after this Waraqah died."
			</p>
			<p>
				This narrative is explicit that even until a moment
				before the coming Angel the Holy Messenger of Allah
				intimately aware of his life, his affairs and dealings.
				When he also heard of his experience, she did not regard
				it as an evil suggestion, but immediately said that it
				was the Namus who had descended on Moses (peace be upon
				him). This meant that even according to him the Holy
				Prophet was such a sublime person that there was nothing
				surprising in his being elevated to the office of
				Prophethood.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Occasion of Revelation of vv. 6-19">
			<p>
				This second part of thee Surah was revealed when the Holy
				Messenger of Allah began to perform the Prayer in the
				Islamic way in the Ka'bah and Abu Jahl threatened and
				tried to prevent him from this. It so happened that after
				his appointment to Prophethood even before he could start
				preaching Islam openly, he began to perform the Prayer in
				the precincts of the Ka'bah in the way Allah taught him;
				and from this the Quraish felt for the first time that he
				had adopted a new religion. The other people were
				watching it with curiosity, but Abu Jahl in his arrogance
				and pride threatened the Holy Prophet and forbade him to
				worship in that way in the Ka'bah. In this connection,
				quite a number of the hadith have been related from
				Hadrat Abdullah ibn Abbas and Hadrat Abu Huraira, which
				mention the foolish behavior of Abu Jahl.
			</p>
			<p>
				Hadrat Abu Huraira says that Abu Jahl asked the people of
				Quraish: "Does Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and
				blessings) set his face on the ground before you?" When
				they replied in the affirmative, he said: "By Lat and
				Uzza, if I ever catch him in that act of worship, I would
				set my foot on his neck and rub his face in the dust."
				Then it so happened that he saw the Holy Messenger in
				that posture and came forward to set his foot on his
				neck, but suddenly turned back as if in a fright and
				being asked what was the matter, he said there was a
				ditch of fire and a terrible apparition between himself
				and Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings)
				and some wings. On hearing this the Holy Prophet
				remarked: "Had he come near me, the angels would have
				smitten and torn him to pieces." (Ahmad, Muslim, Nasai,
				Ibn Jarir, Ibn AbI Hatim, Ibn al-Mundhir, lbn Marduyah,
				Abu Nu'aim Isfahani, Baihaqi).
			</p>
			<p>
				According to lbn Abbas, Abu Jahl said:"If I caught
				Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings)
				performing his Prayer by the Ka'bah, I would trample his
				neck down." When the Holy Prophet heard of it, he said:
				"If he acted so, the angels would seize him there and
				then." (Bukhari, Tirmidhi, Nasai, Ibn Jarir, Abdur
				Razzaq, Abd bin Humaid, Ibn al- Mundhir, Ibn Marduyah).
			</p>
			<p>
				According to another tradition from Ibn Abbas, the Holy
				Prophet was performing his Prayer at the Maqam Ibrahim.
				Abu Jahl passed that way and said: "O Muhammad, did I not
				forbid you this," and then he started to threaten him. In
				reply the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) rebuked him
				severely. There upon he said: "O Muhammad, on what
				strength do you rebuke me? By God, my followers in this
				valley far exceed yours in number." (Ahmad, Tirmidhi,
				Nasai, Ibn Jarir, lbn Abi Shaibah, Ibn al-Mundhir,
				Tabarani, Ibn Marduyah).

				Whether it is a Makki or a Madani revelation is disputed.
				Abu Hayyan in Al-Bahr al-Muhti has made the claim that
				the majority of scholars regard it as a Madani Surah. All
				bin Ahmad al-Wahidi in his commentary says that this is
				the first Surah to be sent down in Madinah. Contrary to
				this, Al Mawardi says that occording to the majority of
				scholars it is a Makki revelation, and the same view has
				Imam Suyuti expressed in Al-Itqan. Ibn Mardayah has cited
				Ibn Abbas, Ibn Az Zubair and Hadrat Aishah as saying that
				this Surah was revealed at Makkah. A study of the
				contents also shows that it should have been revealed at
				Makkah as we shall explain below.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				Its theme is to acquaint man with the value, worth and
				importance of the Quran. Its being placed just after
				Surah Al-Alaq in the arrangement of the Quran by itself
				explains that the Holy Book, the revelation of which
				began with the first five verses of Surah Al-Alaq. was
				sent down in a destiny making night. It is a glorious
				Book and its revelation for mankind is full of blessings.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the outset, Allah says: "We have sent it down." That
				is, it is not a composition of Muhammad (upon whom be
				Allah's peace and blessing) himself, but We Ourself have
				revealed it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, it is said that "We sent it down in the Night of
				Destiny." Night of Destiny has two meanings and both are
				implied here. First, that it is the night during which
				destinies are decided; or, in other words, it is not an
				ordinary night like the other nights, but a night in
				which destinies are made or marred. The revelation of
				this Book in this night is not merely the revelation of a
				book but an event which will change the destiny of not
				only the Quraish, or of Arabia, but of, the entire world.
				The same thing has been said in Surah Ad-Dukhan for which
				please see Introduction to that Surah and E. N. 3
				thereof. The other meaning is that this is a night of
				unique honor, dignity and glory; so much so that it is
				better than a thousand months. Thus, the disbelievers of
				Makkah have been warned, as if to say: "You on account of
				your ignorance regard this Book, which Muhammad (upon
				whom be Allah's peace and blessings) has presented, as a
				calamity for yourselves and complain that a disaster has
				befallen you, whereas the night in which it was decreed
				to be sent down was such a blessed night that a task was
				accomplished in it for the well being of mankind, which
				had never been accomplished even during a thousand months
				of history. This also has been said in verse 3 of
				Ad-Dukhan in another way, which we have explained in the
				introduction to that Surah.
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, it has been stated that in this night the
				angels and Gabriel descend with every decree (which in
				verse 4 of Surah Ad-Dukhan has been described as
				arm-hakim: wise decree) by the leave of their Lord, and
				it is all peace from evening till morning; that is, there
				is no interference of evil in it, for all decrees of
				Allah are intended to promote good and not evil. So much
				so that even if a decision to destroy a nation is taken,
				it is taken for the sake of ultimate good, not evil.

				Where it was revealed, at Makkah or Madinah, is also
				disputed. Some commentators say it is a Makki revelation
				according to most scholars; others say it is a Madani
				revelation according to most scholars. Ibn Az Zubair and
				Ata bin Yasar hold the view that it is Madani. Ibn Abbas
				and Qatadah are reported to have held two views, first
				that it is Makki, second that it is Madani. Hadrat Aishah
				regards it as a Makki Surah. Abu Hayyan, author of Bahr
				al-Muhit, and Abdul Munim ibn al-Faras, author of Ahkam
				al-Quran, also have preferred to regard it as Makki. As
				for its contents, there is nothing in it to indicate
				whether it was revealed at Makkah or at Madinah.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				Its having been placed after Surahs Al-Alaq and Al-Qadr
				in the arrangement of the Quran is very meaningful. Surah
				Al-Alaq contains the very first revelation, while Surah
				Al-Qadr shows as to when it was revealed, and in this
				Surah it has been explained why it was necessary to send
				a Messenger along with this Holy Book.
			</p>
			<p>
				First of all the need of sending a Messenger has been
				explained, saying: The people of the world, be they from
				among the followers of the earlier scriptures or from
				among the idolaters, could not possibly be freed from
				their state of unbelief, until a Messenger was sent whose
				appearance by itself should be a clear proof of his
				apostleship, and he should present the Book of God before
				the people in its original, pristine form, which should
				be free from every mixture of falsehood corrupting the
				earlier Divine Books; and which should comprise sound
				teachings.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, about the errors of the followers of the earlier
				Books it has been said that the cause of their straying
				into different creeds was not that Allah had not provided
				any guidance to them, but they strayed only after a clear
				statement of the Right Creed had come to them. From this
				it automatically follows that they themselves were
				responsible for their error and deviation. Now, if even
				after the coming of the clear statement through this
				Messenger, they continued to stray, their responsibility
				would further increase.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this very connection, it has been stated that the
				Prophets who came from Allah and the Books sent down by
				Him, did not enjoin anything but that the way of sincere
				and true service to Allah be adopted, apart from all
				other ways, no one else's worship, service or obedience
				be mixed with His, the salat be established and the zakat
				be paid. This same has been the true religion since ever.
				From this also it automatically follows that the
				followers of the earlier scriptures, straying from this
				true religion, have added extraneous things to it, which
				are false, and Allah's this Messenger has come to invite
				them back to, the same original faith.
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, it has been pointed out clearly that the
				followers of the earlier Books and the idolaters who
				would refuse to acknowledge this Messenger are the worst
				of creatures: their punishment is an everlasting Hell;
				and the people who would believe and act righteously, and
				would spend life in the world in awe of God, are the best
				of creatures: their reward is eternal Paradise wherein
				they will live for ever. Allah became well pleased with
				them and they became well pleased with Allah.

				Whether or not it was revealed, at Makkah or Madina, is
				disputed. Ibn Masud, Ata, Jabir, and Mujahid say that it
				is a Makki Surah and a statement of Ibn Abbas also
				supports this view. On the contrary, Qatadah and Muqatil
				say that it is Madina and another statement of Ibn Abbas
				also has been cited in support of this view. That it is a
				Madani Surah is reasoned from a tradition from Hadrat Abu
				Sa'id Khudri, which Ibn Abi Hatim has related from him.
				He says: "When the verse Fa-man ya mal mithqala dharratin
				khairan yarah, wa man ya mal mithqala dharratin sharran
				yarah, was revealed, I said: "O Messenger of Allah, shall
				I really see my deeds? The Holy Messenger replied in the
				affirmative. I submitted: And every major sin? He replied
				yes. I said: And the minor sins too? He replied yes.
				Thereupon I exclaimed that I would then be ruined. The
				Holy Prophet said: Rejoice, O Abu Sa'id, for each good
				act will be equal to ten good acts like it." The basis of
				the argument for this Surah's being Madani is that Hadrat
				Abu Sa'id Khudri was an inhabitant of Madinah and reached
				maturity after the Battle of Uhud. Therefore, if this
				Surah was revealed in his presence, as is apparent from
				his statement, it must be a Madani Surah. However, the
				practice that the Companions and their immediate
				successors followed in respect of the occasion of the
				revelation of the verses and Surahs, has already been
				explained in the Introduction to Surah Ad-Dahr above.
				Therefore, a Companion's saying that a verse was sent
				down on this or that particular occasion is no proof that
				it was sent down on that very occasion. It may well be
				that after coming of age when Hadrat Aba Sa'id heard this
				Surah for the first time from the Holy Prophet, terrified
				by its last portion he might have asked the Holy Prophet
				the questions which we have cited above, and he might
				have narrated the incident saying that when this verse
				was revealed he put this and this question to the Holy
				Prophet. In the absence of this tradition every reader
				who reads the Quran with understandings will feel that it
				is a Makki Surah. More than that: from its theme and
				style he would feel that it must have been sent down in
				the earliest stage at Makkah when the fundamental
				principles and beliefs of Islam were being presented
				before the people in a concise but highly effective way.

				Its object is to make the people realize how evil man

			</p>

				For this purpose the general chaos and confusion
				prevailing in Arabia, with which the whole country was in
				turmoil, has been presented as an argument. Bloodshed,
				loot and plunder raged on every side. Tribes were
				subjecting tribes to raids, and no one could have
				peaceful sleep at night from fear that some enemy tribe
				might raid his settlement early in the morning. Every
				Arab was fully conscious of this state of affairs and
				realized that it was wrong. Although the plundered
				bemoaned his miserable, helpless state and the plunderer
				rejoiced, yet when the plunderer himself was plundered,
				he too realized how abject was the condition in which the
				whole nation was involved. Referring to this very state
				of affairs, it has been said: Unaware of the second life
				after death and his accountability before God in it, man
				has become ungrateful to his Lord and Sustainer. He is
				using the powers and abilities given by God for
				perpetrating tyranny and pillage; blinded by the love of
				worldly wealth he tries to obtain it by every means,
				however impure and filthy, and his own state itself
				testifies that by abusing the powers bestowed by his Lord
				he is being ungrateful to Him. He would never have
				behaved so, had he known the time when the dead will be
				raised from the graves, and when the intentions and
				motives with which he had done all sorts of deeds in the
				world, will be exposed and brought out before everyone to
				see. At that time the Lord and Sustainer of men shall be
				well informed of what one had done and what punishment or

				The Surah taken its name from the word at takathur in the
				first verse.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				Abu Hayyan and Shaukani say that this Surah, according to
				all commentators, is Makki, and this same is the well
				known view according to Iman Suyuti. However, there are
				some traditions, on the basis of which it is considered a
				Madani Surah, and they are as follows:
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Hatim has cited Abu Buraidah as saying that this
				Surah was sent down concerning the two tribes, Bani
				Harithah and Bani al-Harth, of the Ansar. The two tribes
				had first recounted the glories and illustrious deeds of
				their living men; then they had gone to the graveyard and
				bragged of the glorious deeds of their dead. Thereupon
				the Divine Revelation Alhakum at takathur came down. But,
				if the practice of the Companions and their successors
				concerning the occasions of revelation, is kept in view,
				this tradition is no argument to prove that Surah At
				Takathur was sent down on that very occasion, but it
				shows that this Surah fully applied to the act of the two
				tribes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Imam Bukhari and Ibn Jarir have cited this view of Hadrat
				Ubayy bin Ka'b: "We took the Holy Prophet" saying: `If
				the son of Adam had two valley full of wealth, he would
				long for a third valley; the son of Adam's belly cannot
				be filled but by earth, to be from the Quran until
				Alhakum at takathur was sent down'." This Hadith has been
				regarded as an argument for Surah At-Takathur to be a
				Madani Surah on the ground that Hadrat Ubayy had become a
				Muslim in Madinah. But Hadrat Ubayy's this statement does
				not indicate in what sense the Companions regarded this
				saying of the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) as
				belonging to the Quran. If it means that they regarded it
				as a verse of the Quran, it cannot be acceptable, for a
				great majority of the Companions consisted of the men who
				were well aware of each and every word of the Quran; they
				could not have the misunderstanding that the Hadith was a
				verse of the Quran. And if its belonging to the Quran is
				taken to mean its being derived from the Quran, the
				tradition can also mean that when the Companions who
				entered Islam in Madinah, heard this Surah for the first
				time from the Holy Prophet, they thought that it had been
				revealed just then, and then about the Holy Prophet's
				above saying they formed the idea that it was derived
				from this very Surah.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Jarir Tirmidhi, Ibn al Mundhir and other
				traditionists have related this view of Hadrat Ali: "We
				were in doubt about the torment of the grave until
				Alhakum at takathur was sent down." This view has been
				regarded as an argument for Surah At-Takathur to be
				Madani on the ground that the torment of the grave was
				first mentioned at Madinah; no mention of it was ever
				made at Makkah. But this is wrong. In the Makki Surahs of
				the Quran, the torment of the grave has been mentioned at
				many places so clearly that there can he no room for any
				such doubt; for example, see Al- An'am: 93, An-Nahl: 28,
				Al-Muminun: 99-100, Al- Mu'min: 45-46, which are all
				Makki Surahs. Therefore, if anything is proved by Hadrat
				Ali's saying, it is that Surah At-Takathur had been
				revealed before the revelation of the above mentioned
				Makki Surahs and its revelation had removed the
				Companions' doubt about the torment of the grave.
			</p>
			<p>
				That is why, in spite of these traditions, a great
				majority of the commentators are agreed that this Surah
				is Makki. In our opinion this is not only a Makki Surah
				but in view of its contents and style it is one of the
				earliest Surahs to be revealed at Makkah.

				In it some of the evils prevalent among the materialistic

				of the people having this kind of character has been
				stated. Both these things (i.e. the character and his

				makes the listener automatically reach the conclusion
				that such a man fitly deserves to meet such an end. And
				since in the world, people of such character do not

			</p>
			<p>
				If this Surah is read in the sequence of the Surahs
				beginning with Az-Zilzal, one can fully well understand
				how the fundamental beliefs of Islam and its teachings
				were impressed on the peoples minds in the earliest stage
				in Makkah. In Surah Az-Zilzal, it was said that in the
				Hereafter man's full record will be placed before him and
				not an atom's weight of good or evil done by him in the
				world will have been left unrecorded. In Surah Al-Adiyat,
				attention was drawn to the plunder and loot, blood-shed
				and vandalism, prevailing in Arabia before Islam; then
				making the people realize that the way the powers given
				by God were being abused was indeed an expression of
				sheer ingratitude to Him; they were told that the matter
				would not end up in the world, but in the second life
				after death--not only their deeds but their intentions
				and motives too would be examined, and their Lord fully
				well knows which of them deserves what reward or
				punishment. In Surah Al-Qariah after depicting
				Resurrection the people were warned that in the Hereafter
				a man's good or evil end will be dependent on whether the
				scale of his good deeds was heavier, or the scale of his
				evil deeds was heavier: In Surah At-Takathur the people
				were taken to task for the materialistic mentality
				because of which they remained occupied in seeking
				increase in worldly benefits, pleasures, comforts and
				position, and in vying with one another for abundance of
				everything until death overtook them. Then, warning them
				of the evil consequences of their heedlessness, they were
				told that the world was not an open table of food for
				then to pick and choose whatever they pleased, but for
				every single blessing that they were enjoying in the
				world, they would have to render an account to their Lord
				and Sustainer as to how they obtained it and how they
				used it. In Surah Al-Asr it was declared that each
				member, each group and each community of mankind, even
				the entire world of humanity, was in manifest loss, if
				its members were devoid of Faith and righteous deeds and
				of the practice of exhorting others to truth and
				patience. Immediately after this comes Surah Al-Humazah
				in which after presenting a specimen of leadership of the
				pre-Islamic age of ignorance, the people have been asked
				the question: "What should such a character deserve if
				not loss and perdition?"

		<section heading="Historical Background">
			<p>
				As we have explained in E. N. 4 of Surah Al-Buruj above,
				in retaliation for the persecution of the followers of
				the Prophet Jesus Christ (peace be on him) in Najran by
				the Jewish ruler Dhu-Nuwas of Yaman, the Christian
				kingdom of Abyssinia invaded Yaman and put an end to the
				Himyarite rule there, and in 525 A.D. this whole land
				passed under Abyssinian control. This happened, in fact,
				through collaboration between the Byzantine empire of
				Constantinople and the Abyssinian kingdom, for the
				Abyssinians at that time had no naval fleet. The fleet
				was provided by Byzantium and Abyssinia sent 70,000 of
				its troops by it across the Red Sea to Yaman. At the
				outset one should understand that all this did not happen
				under the religious zeal but there were economic and
				political factors also working behind it, and probably
				these were the real motive, and retaliation for the
				Christian blood was just an excuse. Since the time the
				Byzantine empire had occupied Egypt and Syria, it had
				been trying to gain control over the trade going on
				between East Africa, India, Indonesia, etc., and the
				Byzantine dominions: from the Arabs, who had been
				controlling it for centuries, so as to earn maximum
				profits by eliminating the intermediary Arab merchants.
				For this purpose, in 24 or 25 B.C., Caesar Augustus sent
				a large army under the Roman general, Aelius Gallus,
				which landed on the western coast of Arabia, in order to
				intercept and occupy the sea route between southern
				Arabia and Syria. But the campaign failed to achieve its
				objective on account of the extreme geographical
				conditions of Arabia. After this, the Byzantines brought
				their fleet into the Red Sea and put an end to the Arab
				trade which they carried out by sea, with the result that
				they were left only with the land route. To capture this
				very land route they conspired with the Abyssinian
				Christians and aiding them with their fleet helped them
				to occupy Yaman.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Arab historians statements about the Abyssinian army
				that invaded Yaman are different. Hafiz Ibn Kathir says
				that it was led by two commanders, Aryat and Abrahah, and
				according to Muhammad bin Ishaq, its commander was Aryat,
				and Abrahah was included in it. Then both are agreed that
				Aryat and Abrahah fell out, Aryat was killed in the
				encounter, and Abrahah took possession of the country;
				then somehow he persuaded the Abyssinian king to appoint
				him his viceroy over Yaman. On the contrary, the Greek
				and Syriac historians state that when after the conquest
				of Yaman, the Abyssinians started putting to death the
				Yamanite chiefs, who had put up resistance, one of the
				chiefs, named As-Sumayfi Ashwa (whom the Greek historians
				call Esymphaeus) yielded to the Abyssinians and promising
				to pay tribute obtained the Abyssinian king's warrant to
				be governor over Yaman. But the Abyssinian army revolted
				against him and made Abrahah governor in his place. This
				man was the slave of a Greek merchant of the Abyssinian
				seaport of Adolis, who by clever diplomacy had come to
				wield great influence in the Abyssinian army occupying
				Yaman. The troops sent by the Negus to punish him either
				warned him or were defeated by him. Subsequently, after
				the death of the king, his successor was reconciled to
				accept him as his vicegerent of Yaman. (The Greek
				historians write him as Abrames and the Syriac historians
				as Abraham. Abrahah perhaps is an Abyssinian variant of
				Abraham, for its Arabic version is Ibrahim).
			</p>
			<p>
				This man through passage of time became an independent
				ruler of Yaman. He acknowledged the sovereignty of the
				Negus only in name and described himself as his deputy.
				The influence he wielded can be judged from the fact that
				after the restoration of the dam of Marib in 543 A.D. he
				celebrated the event by holding a grand feast, which was
				attended by the ambassadors of the Byzantine emperor,
				king of Iran, king of Hirah, and king of Ghassan. Its
				full details are given in the inscription that Abrahah
				installed on the dam. This inscription is extant and
				Glaser has published it.(For further details, see E. N.
				37 of the commentary of Surah Saba).
			</p>
			<p>
				After stabilizing his rule in Yaman Abrahah turned his
				attention to the objective which from the very beginning
				of this campaign had been before the Byzantine empire and
				its allies, the Abyssinian Christians, i.e. to spread
				Christianity in Arabia, on the one hand, and to capture
				the trade that was carried out through the Arabs between
				the eastern lands and the Byzantine dominions, on the
				other. The need for this increased because the Byzantine
				struggle for power against the Sasanian empire of Iran
				had blocked all the routes of the Byzantine trade with
				the East.
			</p>
			<p>
				To achieve this objective, Abrahah built in Sana, the
				capital of Yaman, a magnificent cathedral, called by the
				Arabian historians al-Qalis, al-Qullais, or al-Qulais,
				this word being an Arabic version of the Greek word
				Ekklesia, church. According, to Mahammad bin lshaq, after
				having completed the building, he wrote to the Negus,
				saying: "I shall not rest until I have diverted the Arabs
				pilgrimage to it." Ibn Kathir writes that he openly
				declared his intention in Yaman and got it publicly
				announced. He, in fact, wanted to provoke the Arabs into
				doing something which should provide him with an excuse
				to attack Makkah and destroy the Ka'bah. Muhammad bin
				Ishaq says that an Arab, enraged at this public
				proclamation somehow went into the cathedral and defiled
				it. Ibn Kathir says this was done by a Quraishite and
				according to Muqatil bin Suleman, some young men of the
				Quraish had set fire to the cathedral. Either might have
				happened, for Abrahah's proclamation was certainly
				provocative and in the ancient pre-Islamic age it cannot
				be impossible that an Arab, or a Quraishite youth, might
				have been enraged and might have defiled the cathedral,
				or set fire to it. But it may well also be that Abrahah
				himself got this done secretly by his own agent so as to
				have an excuse for invading Makkah and thus achieving
				both his objectives by destroying the Quraish and
				intimidating the Arabs. In any case, whatever happened,
				when the report reached Abrahah that the devotees of the
				Ka'bah had thus defiled his cathedral, he swore that he
				would not rest until he had destroyed the Ka'bah.
			</p>
			<p>
				So, in 570 or 571 A.D., he took 60,000 troops and 13
				elephants (according to another tradition, 9 elephants)
				and set off for Makkah. On the way, first a Yamanite
				chief, Dhu Nafr by name, mustering an army of the Arabs,
				resisted him but was defeated and taken prisoner. Then in
				the country of Khath'am he was opposed by Nufail bin
				Habib al-Khath'am, with his tribe, but he too was
				defeated and taken prisoner, and in order to save his
				life he accepted to serve him as guide in the Arab
				country. When he reached near Ta'if, Bani Thaqif felt
				that they would not be able to resist such a big force
				and feeling the danger lest he should destroy the temple
				of their deity Lat, too; their chief, Mas'ud came out to
				Abrahah with his men, and he told him that their temple
				was not the temple he had come to destroy. The temple He
				sought was in Makkah, and they would send with him a man
				to guide him there. Abrahah accepted the offer, and Bani
				Thaqif sent Abu Righal as guide with him. When they
				reached al-Mughammas (or al-Mughammis), a place about 3
				miles short of Makkah, Abu Righal died, and the Arabs
				stoned his grave and the practice survives to this day.
				They cursed the Bani Thaqif too, for in order to save the
				temple of Lat they had cooperated with the invaders of
				the House of Allah.
			</p>
			<p>
				According to Muhammad bin Ishaq, from al-Mughammas
				Abrahah sent forward his vanguard and they brought him
				the plunder of the people of Tihamah and Quraish, which
				included two hundred camels of Abdul Muttalib, the
				grandfather of the Holy Messenger of Allah (upon whom be
				His peace). Then, he sent an envoy of his to Makkah with
				the message that he had not come to fight the people of
				Makkah but only to destroy the House (i.e. the Ka'bah).
				If they offered no resistance, there would be no cause
				for bloodshed. Abrahah also instructed his envoy that if
				the people of Makkah wanted to negotiate, he should
				return with their leading chief to him. The leading chief
				of Makkah at that time was Abdul Muttalib. The envoy went
				to him and delivered Abrahah's message. Abdul Muttalib
				replied: "We have no power to fight Abrahah. This is
				Allah's House. If He wills He will save His House." The
				envoy asked him to go with him to Abrahah. He agreed and
				accompanied him to the king. Now Abdul Muttalib was such
				a dignified and handsome man that when Abrahah saw him he
				was much impressed; he got off his throne and sat beside
				him on the carpet. Then he asked him what he wanted.
				Abdul Muttalib replied that he wanted the king to return
				his camels which he had taken. Abrahah said: "I was much
				impressed when I saw you but your reply has brought you
				down in my eyes: you only demand your camels but you say
				nothing about this House which is your sanctuary and the
				sanctuary of your forefathers." He replied: "I am the
				owner of my camels and am requesting you to return them.
				As for the House, it has its own Owner: He will defend
				it." When Abrahah said that He would not be able to
				defend it against him, Abdul Muttalib said that that
				rested between Him and him. With this Abdul Muttalib left
				Abrahah and he restored to him his camels.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Abbas's tradition is different. It does not mention
				the demand for the camels at all. According to the
				traditions related from him by Abd bin Humaid, Ibn
				al-Mundhir, lbn Marduyah, Hakim, Abu Nuaim and Baihaqi,
				he states that when Abrahah reached As- Sifah (a place
				situated between Arafat and Taif in the mountains near
				the sacred bounds of Makkah), Abdul Muttalib went to him
				and said: "There was no need for you to come so far. You
				should have ordered us and we would have brought before
				you whatever you needed." He said: "I hear that this
				House is the House of peace: I have come to destroy its
				peace." Thereupon, Abdul Muttalib said: "This is Allah's
				House. He has not allowed anyone so far to dominate it."
				Abrahah replied: "We will not return until we have
				destroyed it." Abdul Muttalib said: "You may take
				whatever you like from us and return." Abrahah refused to
				budge and ordered his troops to advance, leaving Abdul
				Muttalib behind.
			</p>
			<p>
				Leaving the two traditions as they are, one thing which
				becomes evident is that the tribes living in and around
				Makkah did not have the power to fight such a big force
				and save the Ka'bah. Therefore, obviously, the Quraish
				did not try to put up any resistance. The Quraish on the
				occasion of the Battle of the Trench (Ahzab) had hardly
				been able to muster strength numbering ten to twelve
				thousand men in spite of the alliance with the pagan and
				Jewish tribes; they could not have resisted an army
				60,000 strong.
			</p>
			<p>
				Muhammad bin Ishaq says that after returning from the
				camp of Abrahah Abdul Muttalib ordered the Quraish to
				withdraw from the city and go to the mountains along with
				their families for fear of a general massacre. Then he
				went to the Ka'bah along with some chiefs of the Quraish
				and taking hold of the iron ring of the door, prayed to
				Allah Almighty to protect His House and its keepers.
				There were at that time 360 idols in and around the
				Ka'bah, but on that critical moment they forgot them and
				implored only Allah for help. Their supplications which
				have been reported in the books of history do not contain
				any name but of Allah, the One. Ibn Hisham in his Life of
				the Prophet has cited some verses of Abdul Muttalib,
				which are to the following effect:
			</p>
			<p>
				"O God, a man protects his house, so protect Your House;
				Let not their cross and their craft tomorrow overcome
				Your craft. If You will to leave them and our qiblah to
				themselves, You may do as You please." Suhail in Raud
				al-Unuf has cited this verse also in this connection:
				"Help today Your devotees against the devotees of the
				cross and its worshipers." Ibn Jarir has cited Abdul
				Muttalib's these verses also, which he had recited in his
				supplication; my Lord, I do not cherish any hope from
				anyone against them except You. O my Lord, protect Your
				House from them. The enemy of this House is Your enemy.
				Stop them from destroying Your settlement."
			</p>
			<p>
				After making these supplications Abdul Muttalib and his
				companions also went off to the mountains. Next morning
				Abrahah prepared to enter Makkah, but his special
				elephant, Mahmud, which was in the forefront, knelt down.
				It was beaten with iron bars, goaded, even scarified, but
				it would not get up. When they made it face south, north,
				or east, it would immediately start off, but as soon as
				they directed it towards Makkah, it knelt down. In the
				meantime swarms of birds appeared carrying stones in
				their beaks and claws and showered these on the troops.
				Whoever was hit would start disintegrating. According to
				Muhammad bin Ishaq and Ikrimah, this was smallpox, which
				was seen in Arabia for the first time in that year. Ibn
				Abbas says that whoever was struck by a pebble, would
				start scratching his body resulting in breaking of the
				skin and falling off of the flesh. In another tradition
				Ibn Abbas says that the flesh and blood flowed like water
				and bones in the body became visible. The same thing
				happened with Abrahah too. His flesh fell in pieces and
				there arose bores on his body emitting pus and blood. In
				confusion they withdrew and fled towards Yaman. Nufail
				bin Habib, whom they had brought as guide from the
				country of Khatham, was searched out and asked to guide
				them back to Yaman, but he refused and said: "Now where
				can one flee when God pursues?
			</p>
			<p>
				The split nose (Abrahah) is the conquered; not the
				conqueror."
			</p>
			<p>
				As they withdrew they were continually falling by the bay
				and dying. Ata bin Yasar says that all the troops did not
				perish at the spot; some perished there and others
				perished by the wayside as they withdrew. Abrahah died in
				the country of Khatham.
			</p>
			<p>
				This event took place at Muhassir by the Muhassab valley,
				between Muzdalifah and Mina. According to the Sahih of
				Muslim and Abu Da'ud, in the description of the Holy
				Prophet's farewell pilgrimage that Imam Jafar as-Sadiq
				has related from his father, Imam Muhammad Baqir, and he
				from Hadrat Jabir bin Abdullah, he says that when the
				Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) proceeded from
				Muzdalifah to Mina, he increased his speed in the valley
				of Muhassir. Imam Nawawt has explained it saying that the
				incident of the people of the elephant had occurred
				there; therefore, the pilgrims have been enjoined to pass
				by quickly, for Muhassir is a tormented place. Imam Malik
				in Muatta has related that the Holy Prophet said that the
				whole of Muzdalifah is a fit place for staying but one
				should not stay in the valley of Muhassir. In the verses
				of Nufail bin Habib, which Ibn Ishaq has cited, he
				describes this event as an eyewitness;
			</p>
			<p>
				"Would that you had seen, O Rudaina, but you would not
				see, What we saw by the valley of Muhassab. I praised God
				when I saw the birds, and I feared lest the stones should
				fall upon us. Everyone was asking for Nufail as though I
				owned the Abyssinians a debt."
			</p>
			<p>
				This was such a momentous event that it soon spread
				throughout Arabia and many poets made it the subject of
				their laudatory poems. In these poems one thing is quite
				evident that everyone regarded it as a manifestation of
				Allah Almighty's miraculous power, and no one, even by
				allusion, said that the idols which were worshipped in
				the Ka'bah, had anything to do with it. For example,
				Abdullah ibn Az-Zibara says:
			</p>
			<p>
				"The sixty thousand returned not home, Nor did their sick
				man (Abrahah) survive on return. Ad and Jurham were there
				before them, and there is Allah, above the servants, Who
				sustains it." Abu Qais bin Aslat says; "Rise and worship
				your Lord and anoint the Corners of the House of Allah
				between the Mountains of Makkah and Mina. When the help
				of the Owner of the Throne reached you, His armies
				repulsed them so that they were lying in dust, pelted
				with stones."
			</p>
			<p>
				Not only this, but according to Hadrat Umm Hani and
				Hadrat Zubair bin al-Awwam, the Holy Prophet (upon whom
				be peace) said: "The Quraish did not worship anyone but
				Allah, the Only and One, for ten years (and according to
				others, for seven years). Umm Hani's tradition has been
				related by Imam Bukhari in his History and by Tabarani,
				Hakim, Ibn Marduyah and Baihaqi in their collections of
				hadith Hadrat Zubair's statement has been related by
				Tabarani, Ibn Marduyah and Ibn Asakir, and this is
				further confirmed by the mursal tradition of Hadrat Sa'id
				bin al Musayyab, which Khatib Baghdadi has recorded in
				his History.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Arabs describe the year in which this event took
				place as Am al-Fil (the year of the elephants), and in
				the same year the Holy Messenger of Allah (upon whom be
				His peace) was born. The traditionists and historians
				almost unanimously state that the event of the people of
				the elephant had occurred in Muharram and the Holy
				Prophet was born in Rabi al-Awwam. A majority of them
				states that he took birth 50 days after the event of the
				elephant.
			</p>

		<section heading="Theme and Substance">
			<p>
				If Surah al-Fil is studied in the light of the historical
				details as given above, one can fully well understand why
				in this Surah only Allah's inflicting His punishment on
				the people of the elephant has been referred and
				described so briefly. It was an event of recent
				occurrence, and everyone in Makkah and Arabia was fully
				aware of it. The Arabs believed that the Ka'bah had been
				protected in this invasion not by any god or goddess but
				by Allah Almighty Himself. Then Allah alone had been
				invoked by the Quraish chiefs for help, and for quite a
				few years the people of Quraish having been impressed by
				this event, had worshipped none but Allah. Therefore,
				there was no need to mention the details in Surah al-Fil,
				but only a reference to it was enough so that the people
				of Quraish, in particular, and the people of Arabia, in
				general, should consider well in their hearts the message
				that the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's
				peace and blessings) was giving. For the only message
				that he gave was that they should worship and serve none
				but Allah, the Only and One. Then, they should also
				consider that if they used force to suppress this
				invitation to the truth, they would only be inviting the
				wrath of God, Who had so completely routed and destroyed
				the people of the elephants.

				The Surah has been so entitled after the word Quraish in
				the very first verse.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				Although Dahhak and Kalbi regard it as a Madani Surah,
				yet a great majority of the commentators are agreed that
				it is Makki, and a manifest evidence of this are the
				words Rabba hadh-al-Bait (Lord of this House) of this
				Surah itself. Had it been revealed at Madinah, the words
				"this House" for the Ka'bah could not be relevant.
				Moreover, its subject matter so closely relates to that
				of Surah Al-Fil that probably it was revealed immediately
				after it, without any other Surah intervening between
				them. On the basis of this very relevance, some of the
				earliest scholars regard the two Surahs as one entity.
				This view is strengthened by the traditions which say
				that in the Quran copy belonging to Hadrat Ubayy bin Ka'b
				these two were written as one Surah, i.e. without the
				insertion of the Bismillah between them. Furthermore,
				Hadrat Umar had once recited the two Surahs as one in the
				Prayer. But this view is not acceptable because in the
				Quran copy which Hadrat Uthman (may Allah bless him) had
				got written down officially by the cooperation of a large
				number of the Companions and sent to the centers of
				Islamic lands, the Bismillah was written between these
				two Surahs, and since then these two have been written as
				separate Surahs in all the copies of the Quran everywhere
				in the world. Moreover, the style of the two Surahs is so
				different that they manifestly appear as two separate
				Surahs.

		<section heading="Historical Background">
			<p>
				To understand the Surah well it is essential that one
				should keep the historical background relevant to the
				contents of this Surah and of Surah Al-Fil in view.
			</p>
			<p>
				The tribe of Quraish was scattered throughout Hijaz until
				the time of Qusayy bin Kilab, the ancestor of the Holy
				Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace). First of all,
				Qusayy gathered it in Makkah and this tribe was able to
				gain authority over the Ka'bah. On that very basis Qusayy
				was called mujammi (unite, assembler) by his people. This
				man by his sagacity and wisdom founded a city state in
				Makkah and made excellent arrangements for the welfare of
				the pilgrims coming from all over Arabia, with the result
				that the Quraish were able to gain great influence among
				the Arabian tribes and lands. After Qusayy the offices of
				the state of Makkah were divided between his sons, Abdi
				Manaf and Abd ad-Dar, but of the two Abdi Manaf gained
				greater fame even during his father's lifetime and was
				held in high esteem throughout Arabia. Abdi Manaf had
				four sons: Hashim, Abdi Shams, Al-Muttalib, and Naufal.
				Of these Hashim, father of Abdul Muttalib and grandfather
				of the Holy Prophet, first conceived the idea to take
				part in the trade that passed between the eastern
				countries and Syria and Egypt through Arabia, and also to
				purchase the necessities of life for the Arabians so that
				the tribes living by the trade route bought these from
				them and the merchants living in the interior of the
				country were attracted to the market of Makkah. This was
				the time when the Sasanian kingdom of Iran had captured
				the international trade that was carried out between the
				northern lands and the eastern countries and Byzantine
				empire through the Persian Gulf. This had boosted up the
				trade activity on the trade route leading from southern
				Arabia to Syria and Egypt along the Red Sea coast. As
				against the other Arabian caravans, the Quraish had the
				advantage that the tribes on the route held them in high
				esteem on account off their being keepers of the Ka'bah.
				They stood indebted to them for the great generosity with
				which the Quraish treated them in the Hajj season. That
				is why tube Quraish felt no fear that their caravans
				would be robbed or harmed any where on the way. The
				tribes on the way did not even charge them the heavy
				transit taxes that they demanded from the other caravans.
				Hashim taking advantage of this prepared the trade scheme
				and made his three brothers partners in it. Thus, Hashim
				obtained trade privileges from the Ghassanide king of
				Syria, Abdi Shams from the Negus, Al-Muttalib from the
				Yamanite nobles and Naufal from the governments of Iraq
				and lran, and their trade began to flourish. That is how
				the four brothers became famous as traders and began to
				be called ashab al-ilaf (generators of love and
				affection) on account of their friendly relations with
				the tribes and states of the surrounding lands.
			</p>
			<p>
				Because of their business relations with Syria, Egypt,
				Iraq, Iran, Yaman and Abyssinia, the Quraish came across
				such opportunities and their direct contact with the
				culture and civilization of different countries so
				enhanced the level of their knowledge and wisdom that no
				tribe in Arabia could match and equal them. As regards
				wealth and worldly goods they became the most affluent
				tribe, and Makkah became the most important commercial
				center of the Arabian peninsula. Another great advantage
				that accursed from these international relations was that
				they brought from Iraq tile script which later was used
				for writing down the Quran. No other Arabian tribe could
				boast of so many literate people as Quraish. For these
				very reasons the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) said:
				"Quraish are the leaders of men." (Mustiad Ahmad:
				Marwiyat Amr bin al As). And according to a tradition
				from Hadrat Ali in Baihaqi, the Holy Prophet said: "First
				the leadership of the Arabians was in the hands of the
				people of Himyar, then Allah withdrew it from them and
				gave it to Quraish"
			</p>
			<p>
				The Quraish were thus prospering and flourishing when the
				event of Abrahah's invasion of Makkah took place. Had
				Abrahah at that time succeeded in taking this holy City
				and destroying the Ka'bah, the glory and renown of not
				only the Quraish but of the Ka'bah itself, would have
				faded away, the belief of the pre-Islamic Arabia that the
				House indeed was Allah's House would have been shattered,
				and the high esteem in which Quraish were held for being
				keepers of the House throughout the country would have
				been tarnished. Then, after the Abyssinian advance to
				Makkah, the Byzantium also would have taken the
				initiative to gain control over the trade route between
				Syria and Makkah: and the Quraish would have been reduced
				to a plight worse than that in which they were involved
				before Qusayy bin Kilab. But when Allah showed this
				manifestation of His power that the swarms of birds
				destroyed 60,000 Abyssinian troops brought by Abrahah by
				pelting them with stones, and from Makkah to Yaman they
				went on falling and dying by the wayside, the faith of
				the Arabs that the Ka'bah indeed was Allah's House
				increased manifold, and the glory and renown of Quraish
				too was enhanced considerably throughout the country. Now
				the Arabs were convinced that they were under Allah's
				special favor; therefore, they visited every part of
				Arabia fearlessly and passed through every land with
				their trade caravans unharmed. No one could dare touch
				them with an evil intention. Not to speak of touching
				them, even if they had a non-Quraishunder their
				protection, he too was allowed to pass unharmed.

				As all this was well known in the time of the Holy
				Prophet's appointment to Prophethood, there was no need
				to mention them. That is why in the four brief sentences
				of this Surah, Quraish were simply asked to consider:
				"When you yourselves acknowledge this House (i. e. the
				Ka'bah) to be Allah's House, and not of the idols, and
				when you fully well know that it is Allah alone Who has
				granted you peace by virtue of this House, made your
				trade and commerce flourish and saving you from
				destitution favored you with prosperity you should then
				worship and serve Him alone!"

			<p>
				Ibn Marduyah has cited Ibn Abbas (may Allah bless them
				both) as saying that this Surah is Makki, and the same
				also is the view of Ata and Jabir. But Abu Hayyan in
				Al-Bahr al-Muhit has cited Ibn Abbas, Qatadah and Dahhak
				as saying that this Surah was revealed at Madinah. In our
				opinion there is an internal piece of evidence in the
				Surah itself which points to its being a Madani
				Revelation. It holds out a threat of destruction to those
				praying ones who are unmindful of their Prayers and who
				pray only to be seen. This kind of hypocrites were found
				only at Madinah, for it was there that Islam and the
				Muslims gained such strength that Islam and the Muslims
				gained such strength that many people were compelled to
				believe from expedience, had to visit the Mosque, join
				the congregational Prayer and prayed only to be seen of
				others, so as to be counted among Muslims. Contrary to
				this is, at Makkah conditions were altogether different.
				No one had to pray to be seen. There it was difficult
				even for the believers to pray in congregation; they
				prayed secretly and if a person prayed openly he did so
				only at the risk of his life. This kind of hypocrites
				found in Makkah did not comprise those who believed and
				Prayed to be seen but those who in their hearts had known
				and acknowledged the Holy Messenger of Allah (upon whom
				be peace) to be on the true path, but were avoiding to
				accept Islam in order to maintain their position of
				leadership and authority, or were not prepared to take
				the risk of being afflicted with the kind of hardships
				with which they found the believers afflicted in the
				society around them. This condition of the hypocrites at
				Makkah has been described in vv. 10-11 of Surah
				Al-Ankabut.

				Its theme is to point out what kind of morals a man
				develops when he refuses to believe in the Hereafter. In
				vv 2-3 the condition of the disbelievers who openly belie
				the Hereafter has been described, and in the last four
				verses the state of those hypocrites who apparently are
				Muslims but have no idea of the Hereafter, its judgment,
				and the meting out of rewards and punishments accordingly
				has been described. On the whole, the object of depicting
				the attitude and conduct of two kinds of people is to
				impress the point that man cannot develop a strong,
				stable and pure character in himself unless he believes
				in the Hereafter.

				Ibn Marduyah has cited Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas, Hadrat
				Abdullah bin az-Zubair and Hadrat Aishah as saying that
				this Surah is Makki. Kalbi and Muqatil also regard it as
				Makki, and the same is the view held by the majority of
				commentators. But Hadrat Hasan Basri, Ikrimah, Mujahid
				and Qatadah regard it as Madani. Imam Suyuti in Al-Itqan
				has confirmed this same view, and Imam Nawawi in his
				commentary of the Sahih of Muslim has also preferred the
				same. The reason for this assumption is the tradition
				which traditionists of the rank of Imam Ahmad, Muslim,
				Abu Daud, Nasai, Ibn Abi Shaibah, Ibn al-Mundhir, Ibn
				Marduyah, Baihaqi and others have related from Hadrat
				Anas bin Malik, saying: "The Holy Prophet was among us.
				In the meantime he dozed; then he raised his head,
				smiling, according to some traditions, the people asked
				what for he was smiling, according to others, he himself
				told them that a Surah had just been revealed to him.
				Then, with Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim, he recited Surah
				Al-Kauthar; then he asked the people whether they knew
				what Kauthar was. When they said that Allah and his
				Messenger had the best knowledge, he said; It is a river
				which my Lord has granted me in Paradise." (The details
				follow under "Kauthar"). The basis of the reasoning from
				this tradition for this Surah's being Madani is that
				Hadrat Anas belonged to Madinah, and his saying that this
				Surah was revealed in his presence is a proof that it was
				Madani.
			</p>
			<p>
				But, in the first place, from this same Hadrat Anas, Imam
				Ahmad, Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Da'ud, Tirmidhi and Ibn Jarir
				have related the traditions which say that this river of
				Paradise (Al-Kauthar) had been shown to the Holy Prophet
				(upon whom be peace) on the occasion of the miraj
				(ascension) and everyone knows that miraj had taken place
				at Makkah before the hijrah. Secondly, when during the
				miraj the Holy Prophet had not only been informed of this
				gift of Allah Almighty but also shown it, there was no
				reason why Surah Al-Kauthar should have be revealed at
				Madinah to give him the good news of it. Thirdly, if in
				an assembly of the Companions the Holy Prophet himself
				had given the news of the revelation of Surah Al-Kauthar
				which Hadrat Anas has mentioned in his tradition, and it
				meant that that Surah had been revealed for the first
				time then, it was not possible that well-informed
				Companions like Hadrat Aishah, Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas
				and Hadrat Abdullah bin Zubair should have declared this
				Surah to be a Makki revelation and most of the
				commentators also should have regarded it as Makki. If
				the matter is considered carefully, there appears to be a
				flaw in the tradition from Hadrat Anas in that it does
				not say what was the subject under discussion in the
				assembly in which the Holy Prophet gave the news about
				Surah Al-Kauthar. It is possible that at that time the
				Holy Prophet was explaining something. In the meantime he
				was informed by revelation that that point was further
				explained by Surah Al-Kauthar, and he mentioned the same
				thing, saying that that Surah was revealed to him just
				then. Such incidents did take place on several occasions,
				on the basis of which the commentators have opined about
				certain verses that they were revealed twice. This second
				revelation, in fact, meant that the verse had been
				revealed earlier, but on some later occasion the Holy
				Prophet's attention was invited to it by revelation for
				the second time. In such traditions, the mention of the
				revelation of a certain verse is not enough to decide
				whether it was revealed at Makkah or Madinah, and when
				precisely it was revealed.
			</p>
			<p>
				Had this tradition of Hadrat Anas not been there to cause
				doubt, the whole content of the Surah Al- Kauthar by
				itself bears evidence that it was revealed at Makkah, and
				in the period when the Holy Prophet was passing through
				extremely discouraging conditions.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Historical Background">
			<p>
				Before this in Surahs Ad-Duha and Alam Nashrah we have
				seen that when in the earliest phase of Prophethood the
				Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) was passing through the
				most trying conditions when the whole nation had turned
				hostile, there was resistance and opposition on every
				side, and the Holy Prophet and a handful of his
				Companions did not see any remote chance of success.
				Allah in order to console and encourage him at that time
				had sent down several verses. In Surah Ad-Duha it was
				said: "And surely the later period (i.e. every later
				period) is better for you than the former period, and
				soon your Lord shall give you so much that you shall be
				well pleased". In Surah Alam Nashrah: "And We exalted
				your renown for you."That is, "Though the enemies are
				trying to defame you throughout the country, We, on the
				contrary, have arranged to exalt your name and fame."
				And: "The fact is that along with every hardship there is
				also ease." That is, "You should not be disheartened by
				the severity of conditions at this time; this period of
				hardships will soon pass, and the period of success and
				victory will follow."
			</p>
			<p>
				Such were the conditions in which Allah by sending down
				Surah Al-Kauthar consoled the Holy Prophet as well as
				foretold the destruction of his opponents. The
				disbelieving Quraish said: "Muhammad (upon whom be
				Allah's peace) is cut off from his community and reduced
				to a powerless and helpless individual. According to
				Ikrimah when the Holy Prophet was appointed a Prophet,
				and he began to call the people to Islam, the Quraish
				said: "Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and
				blessings) is cut off from his people as a tree is cut
				off from its root, which might fall to the ground any
				moment." (Ibn Jarir). Muhammad bin Ishaq says: "Whenever
				the Prophet (upon whom be peace) was mentioned before As
				bin Wa'il as-Sehmi, the chief of Makkah, he used to say:
				Let him alone for he is only a childless man (abtar) with
				no male offspring. When he dies, there will be no one to
				remember him." Shamir bin Atiyyah says that Uqbah bin Abi
				Mu'ait, also used to say similar things about the Holy
				Prophet, (Ibn Jarir). According to Ibn Abbas, once Ka'b
				bin Ashraf (the Jewish chief of Madinah) came to Makkah
				and the Quraish chiefs said to him: "Just see this boy,
				who is cut off from his people; he thinks he is superior
				to us, whereas we manage the Hajj, look after the Ka'bah
				and water the pilgrims." (Bazzar). Concerning this very
				incident Ikrimah reports that the Quraishhad used the
				words as-sunbur al-munbatir min qaumi-hi (a weak,
				helpless and childless man who is cut off from his
				people) for the Holy Prophet. (Ibn Jarir) Ibn Sa'd and
				Ibn Asakir have related that Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas
				said; "The eldest son of the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
				peace) was Qasim; next to him was Zainab, next to her
				Hadrat Abdullah and next to him three daughters, viz. Umm
				Kulthum, Fatimah and Ruqayyah. Of them first Hadrat Qasim
				died and then Hadrat Abdullah. Thereupon As bin Wail
				said: "His line has come to an end: now he is abtar (i.e.
				cut off from root)." Some traditions add that As said
				"Muhammad is abtar: he has no son to succeed him. When he
				dies, his memory will perish and you will be rid of him."
				The tradition from Ibn Abbas, which Abd bin Humaid has
				related, shows that Abu Jahl also had said similar words
				on the death of the Holy Prophet's son, Abdullah. Ibn Abi
				Hatim has related on the authority of Shmir bin Atiyyah
				that the same kind of meanness was shown by Uqbah bin Abi
				Mu'ait by rejoicing at this bereavement of the Holy
				Prophet. Ata says that when the second son of the Holy
				Prophet died, his own uncle, Abu Lahab (whose house was
				next to his) hastened to the pagans and gave them the
				"good news": Batira Muhammadun al-lail:"Muhammad has
				become childless this night, or he is cut off from root."
			</p>
			<p>
				Such were the disturbing conditions under which Surah
				Al-Kauthar was sent down. The Quraish were angry with him
				because he worshipped and served only Allah and
				repudiated their idolatry publicly. For this very reason
				he was deprived of the rank, esteem and honor that he
				enjoyed among his people before Prophethood and was now
				as cut off from his community. The handful of his
				Companions also were helpless, poor people who were being
				persecuted and tyrannized. Furthermore, he was bereaved
				by the death of two sons, one after the other, whereas
				the near relatives and the people of his clan,
				brotherhood and neighborhood were rejoicing and uttering
				such words as were disheartening and disturbing for a
				noble person who had treated even his enemies most
				kindly. At this Allah just in one sentence of this brief
				Surah gave him the good news, better news than which has
				never been given to any man in the world, besides the
				decision that it will be his opponents who will be cut
				off from their root and not he.

				Hadrat Abdullah bin Mas'ud, Hadrat Hasan Basri and
				Ikrimah, say that this Surah, is Makki, while Hadrat
				Abdullah bin Zubair says that it is Madani. Two different
				views have been reported from Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas
				and Qatadah, first that it is Makki, and second that it
				is Madani. However, according to the majority of
				commentators, it is a Makki Surah, and its subject matter
				itself points to its being a Makki revelation.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Historical Background">
			<p>
				There was a time in Makkah when although a storm of
				opposition had arisen in the pagan society of Quraish
				against the message of Islam preached by the Holy Prophet
				(upon whom be peace), yet the Quraish chiefs had not yet
				lost hope that they would reach some sort of a compromise
				with him. Therefore, from time to time they would visit
				him with different proposals of compromise so that he
				accepted one of them and the dispute between them was
				brought to an end. In this connection, different
				traditions have been related in the Hadith.
			</p>
			<p>
				According to Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas, the Quraish
				proposed to the Holy Prophet; "We shall give you so much
				of wealth that you will become the richest man of Makkah;
				we shall give you whichever woman you like in marriage;
				we are prepared to follow and obey you as our leader,
				only on the condition that you will not speak ill of our
				gods. If you do not agree to this, we present another
				proposal which is to your as well as to our advantage."
				When the Holy Prophet asked what it was, they said that
				if he would worship their gods, Lat and Uzza, for a year,
				they would worship his God for the same space of time.
				The Holy Prophet said: "Wait awhile; let me see what my
				Lord commands in this regard." Thereupon the revelation
				came down: Qul ya-ayyuhal-kafirun...and: Qul afa-ghair
				Allah...(Az-Zumar: 64): "Say to them: ignorant people do
				you bid me to worship others than Allah?" (Ibn Jarir, Ibn
				Abi Hatim, Tabarani). According to another tradition from
				Ibn Abbas, the Quraish said to the Holy Prophet: "O
				Muhammad, if you kiss our gods, the idols, we shall
				worship your God." Thereupon, this Surah was sent down.
				(Abd bin Humaid).
			</p>
			<p>
				Said bin Mina (the freed slave of Abul Bakhtari) has
				related that Walid bin Mughirah, As bin Wail, Aswad bin
				al-Muttalib and Umayyah bin Khalaf met the Holy Prophet
				(upon whom be peace) and said to him: "O Muhammad (upon
				whom be Allah's peace and blessings), let us agree that
				we would worship your God and you would worship our gods,
				and we would make you a partner in all our works. If what
				you have brought was better than what we possess, we
				would be partners in it with You, and have our share in
				it, and if what we possess is better than what you have
				brought, you would be partner in it with us and have your
				share of it." At this Allah sent down: Qul
				ya-ayyuhal-kafirun (Ibn Jarir, Ibn Abi Hatim, Ibn Hisham
				also has related this incident in the Sirah).
			</p>
			<p>
				Wahb bin Munabbih has related that the people of Quraish
				said to Allah's Messenger: "If you like we would enter
				your faith for a year and you would enter our faith for a
				year."(Abd bin Humaid, Ibn Abi Hatim).
			</p>
			<p>
				These traditions show that the Quraish had proposed such
				things to the Holy Prophet not once, in one sitting, but
				at different times and on different occasions; and there
				was need that they should be given a definite, decisive
				reply so that their hope that he would come to terms with
				them on the principle of "give and take" was frustrated
				for ever.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				If the Surah is read with this background in mind, one
				finds that it was not revealed to preach religious
				tolerance as some people of today seem to think, but it
				was revealed in order to exonerate the Muslims from the
				disbelievers religion, their rites of worship, and their
				gods, and to express their total disgust and unconcern
				with them and to tell them that Islam and kufr (unbelief)
				had nothing in common and there was no possibility of
				their being combined and mixed into one entity. Although
				it was addressed in the beginning to the disbelieving
				Quraish in response to their proposals of compromise, yet
				it is not confined to them only, but having made it a
				part of the Quran, Allah gave the Muslims the eternal
				teaching that they should exonerate themselves by word
				and deed from the creed of kufr wherever and in whatever
				form it be, and should declare without any reservation
				that they cannot make any compromise with the
				disbelievers in the matter of Faith. That is why this
				Surah continued to be recited when the people to whom it
				was addressed as a rejoinder, had died and been
				forgotten, and those Muslims also continued to recite it
				who were disbelievers at the time it was revealed, and
				the Muslims still recite it centuries after they have
				passed away, for expression of disgust with and
				dissociation from kufr and its rites is a perpetual
				demand of Faith.
			</p>
			<p>
				As for the esteem in which the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
				peace) held this Surah, it can be judged from the
				following few hadith:
			</p>
			<p>
				Hadrat Abdullah bin Umar (may Allah be pleased with him)
				has related that on many an occasion he heard the Holy
				Prophet recite Surahs Qul Ya-ayyuhal- kafirun and Qul
				Huwu-Allahu ahead in the two rakahs before the Fajr
				obligatory Prayer and in the two rakahs after the Maghrib
				obligatory Prayer. Several traditions on this subject
				with a little variation in wording have been related by
				Imam Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Nasai, Ibn Majah, Ibn Hibban, Ibn
				Marduyah from Ibn Umar.
			</p>
			<p>
				Hadrat Khabbab says: "The Holy Prophet (upon whom be
				peace) said to me: when you lie down in bed to sleep,
				recite Qul ya-ayyuhal kafirun, and this was the Holy
				Prophet's own practice also; when he lay down to sleep,
				he recited this Surah." (Bazzar, Tabarani, Ibn Marduyah).
			</p>
			<p>
				According to Ibn Abbas, the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
				peace) said to the people: "Should I tell you the word
				which will protect you from polytheism? It is that you
				should recite Qul ya-ayyuhal kafirun when you go to
				bed."(Abu Ya'la, Tabarani).
			</p>
			<p>
				Hadrat Anas says that the Holy Prophet said to Hadrat
				Mu'adh bin Jabal; "Recite Qul ya-ayyuhal-kafirun at the
				time you go to bed, for this is immunity from
				polytheism." (Baihaqi in Ash-Shu'ab).
			</p>
			<p>
				Both Fardah bin Naufal and Abdur Rahman bin Naufal have
				stated that their father, Naufal bin Muawiyah al-Ashjai,
				said to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) :"Teach me
				something which I may recite at the time I go to bed."
				The Holy Prophet replied: "Recite Qul ya-ayyuhal kafirun
				to the end and then sleep, for this is immunity from
				polytheism." (Musnad Ahmad, Aba Da'ud, Tirmidhi, Nasai,
				Ibn Abi Shaibah, Hakim, Ibn Marduyah, Baihaqi in
				Ash-Shuab). A similar request was made by Hadrat Jabalah
				bin Harithah, brother of Hadrat Said bin Harithah, to the
				Holy Prophet and to him also he gave the same reply.
				(Musnad Ahmad, Tabarani).

				The Surah takes its name from the word nasr occurring in
				the first verse.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas states that this is the last
				Surah of the Quran to be revealed, i.e. no complete Surah
				was sent down to the Holy Prophet after it. (Muslim
				Nasai, Tabarani, Ibn Abi Shaibah, Ibn Marduyah).
				According to Hadrat Abdullah bin Umar, this Surah was
				sent down on the occasion of the Farewell Pilgrimage in
				the middle of the Tashriq Days at Mina, and after it the
				Holy Prophet rode his she camel and gave his well known
				Sermon. (Tirmidhi, Bazzar, Baihaqi, Ibn Abi Shaibah, Abd
				bin Humaid, Abn Yala, Ibn Marduyah). Baihaqi in Kilab
				al-Hajj has related from the tradition of Hadrat Sarra
				bint-Nabhan the Sermon which the Holy Prophet gave on
				this occasion. She says: "At the Farewell Pilgrimage I
				heard the Holy Prophet say: O people, do you know what
				day it is? They said: Allah and His Messenger have the
				best knowledge. He said: This is the middle day of the
				Tashriq Days. Then he said: Do you know what place it
				is?They said: Allah and His Messenger have the best
				knowledge. He said: This is Masharil-Haram. Then he said:
				I do not know, I might not meet you here again. Beware,
				your bloods and your honors are forbidden, until you
				appear before your Lord, and He questions you about your
				deeds. Listen: let the one who is near convey it to him
				who is far away. Listen: have I conveyed the message to
				you? Then, when we returned to Madinah, the Holy Prophet
				passed away not many days after that."
			</p>
			<p>
				If both these traditions are read together, it appears
				that there was an interval of three months and some days
				between the revelation of Surah An-Nasr and the Holy
				Prophet's death, for historically the same was the
				interval between the Farewell Pilgrimage and the passing
				away of the Holy Prophet.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Abbas says that when this Surah was revealed, the
				Holy Prophet said that he had been informed of his death
				and his time had approached. (Musnad Ahmad, Ibn Jarir,
				Ibn al-Mundhir, Ibn Marduyah). In the other traditions
				related from Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas, it has been
				stated that at the revelation of this Surah the Holy
				Prophet understood that he had been informed of his
				departure from the world.(Musnad Ahmad, Ibn Jarir,
				Tabarani, Nasai, Ibn Abi Hatim, Ibn Marduyah).
			</p>
			<p>
				Mother of the Believers, Hadrat Umm Habibah, says that
				when this Surah was revealed the Holy Prophet said that
				he would leave the world that year. Hearing this Hadrat
				Fatimah wept. Thereat he said: "From among my family you
				will be the first to join me." Hearing this she laughed.
				(Ibn Abi Hatim, Ibn Marduyah). A tradition containing
				almost the same theme has been related by Baihaqi from
				Ibn Abbas.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Abbas says: "Hadrat Umar used to invite me to sit in
				his assembly along with some of the important elderly
				Companions who had fought at Badr. This was not liked by
				some of them. They complained that they also had sons who
				were like the boy. Why then was he in particular invited
				to sit in the assembly? (Imam Bukhari and Ibn Jarir have
				pointed out that such a thing was said by Hadrat Abdur
				Rahman bin Auf). Hadrat Umar said that the boy enjoyed
				the position and distinction because of his knowledge.
				Then one day he invited the Companions of Badr and called
				me also to sit with them. I understood that he had
				invited me to the assembly to prove his contention.
				During the conversation Hadrat Umar asked the Companions
				of Badr: "What do you say about Idha jaa nasrullahi
				wal-fath?" Some said: "In it we have been enjoined to
				praise Allah and ask for His forgiveness when His succor
				comes and we attain victory." Some others said that it
				implied the conquest of cities and forts. Some kept
				quiet. Then Hadrat Umar said: "Ibn Abbas, do you also say
				the same?" I said no. He asked: "What then is your view?"
				I submitted that it implied the last hour of Allah's
				Messenger (upon whom be peace); in it he was informed
				`that when Allah's succor came and victory was attained,
				it would be a sign that his hour had come; therefore, he,
				should praise Allah and ask for His forgiveness. Thereat
				Hadrat Umar said "I know nought but what you have said."
				In another tradition there is the addition that, Hadrat
				Umar said to the Companions: "How can you blame me when
				you yourselves have seen why I invite this boy to join
				the assembly?" (Bukhari, Musnad Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Ibn
				Jarir, Ibn Marduyah, Baghawi, Baihaqi, Ibn al-Mundhir).

				As is shown by the above traditions, Allah in this Surah
				had informed His Messenger (upon whom be peace) that when
				Islam attained complete victory in Arabia and the people
				started entering Allah's religion in great numbers, it
				would mean that the mission for which he had been sent to
				the world, had been fulfilled. Then, he was enjoined to
				busy himself in praising and glorifying Allah by Whose
				bounty he had been able to accomplish such a great task,
				and should implore Him to forgive whatever failings and
				frailties he might have shown in the performance of the
				service. Here, by a little consideration one can easily
				see the great difference that there is between a Prophet
				and a common worldly leader. If a worldly leader in his
				own lifetime is able to bring about a revolution, which
				has the aim and objective of his struggle, this would be
				an occasion for exultation for him. But here we witness
				quite another phenomenon. The Messenger of Allah in a
				brief space of 23 years revolutionized an entire nation
				as regards its beliefs, thoughts, customs, morals,
				civilization, ways of living, economy, politics and
				fighting ability, and raising it from ignorance and
				barbarism enabled it to conquer the world and become
				leader of nations; yet when he had accomplished this
				unique task, he was not enjoined to celebrate it but to
				glorify and praise Allah and to pray for His forgiveness,
				and he busied himself humbly the implementation of that
				command.
			</p>
			<p>
				Hadrat Aishah says: "The Holy Messenger (upon whom be
				peace) often used to recite Subhanak-Allahumma wa
				bi-hamdika astaghfiruka wa atubu ilaika (according to
				some other traditions, Subhan Allahi wa bi hamdi-hi
				as-taghfirullaha wa atubu ilaihi) before his death. I
				asked: O Messenger of Allah, what are these words that
				you have started reciting now? He replied: A sign has
				been appointed for me so that when I see it, I should
				recite these words, and it is: Idha jaa nasrullahi
				wal-fathu." (Musnad Ahmad, Muslim, Ibn Jarir, Ibn
				al-Mundhir, Ibn Marduyah). In some other traditions on
				the same subject Hadrat Aishah has reported that the Holy
				Prophet often recited the following words in his ruku and
				sajdah: Subhanak-Allahumma wa-bi hamdika,
				Allahumma-aghfirli. This was the interpretation of the
				Quran (i.e. of Surah An-Nasr) that he had made.(Bukhari,
				Muslim Abu Daud, Nasai, Ibn Majah, Ibn Jarir).
			</p>
			<p>
				Hadrat Unm Salamah says that the Holy Prophet (upon whom
				be peace) during his last days very often recited the
				following words sitting and standing, going out of the
				house and coming back to it: Subhan Allahi wa-bi
				hamdi-hi. I one day asked: "Why do you recite these words
				so often? O Messenger of Allah". He replied: I have been
				enjoined to do so. Then he recited this Surah. (Ibn
				Jarir).
			</p>
			<p>
				According to Hadrat Abdullah bin Masud, when this Surah
				was revealed, the Messenger of Allah (upon whom be peace)
				frequently began to recite the words Subhanak-Allahumma
				wa bi-hamdika, Allahumm-aghfirli, subhanaka Rabbana wa
				bi-hamdika, Allahumm-aghfirli, innaka anta at-Tawwab
				al-Ghafur.(Ibn Jarir, Musnad Ahmad, Ibn Abi Hatim).
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Abbas has stated that after the revelation of this

				The Surah takes its name from the word Lahab in the first
				verse.

				Although the commentators have not disputed its being a
				Makki Surah, yet it is difficult to determine in which
				phase of the life at Makkah precisely it was revealed.
				However, in view of Abu Lahab's role and conduct against
				the Holy Prophet's message of Truth, it can be assumed
				that it must have been revealed in the period when he had
				transgressed all limits in his mad hostility to him, and
				his attitude was becoming a serious obstruction in the
				progress of Islam. It may well have been revealed in the
				period when the Quraish had boycotted the Holy Prophet
				(upon whom be peace) together with the people of his clan
				and besieged them in Shi'b Abi Talib, and Abu Lahab was
				the only person to join with the enemies against his own
				relatives. The basis of this assumption is that Abu Lahab
				was the Holy Prophet's uncle, and public condemnation of
				the uncle by the tongue of the nephew could not be proper
				until the extreme excesses committed by the uncle had
				become visible to everyone. If the Surah had been
				revealed before this, in the very beginning, the people
				would have regarded it as morally discourteous that the
				nephew should so condemn the uncle.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Background">
			<p>
				This is the only place in the Quran where a person from
				among the enemies of Islam has been condemned by name,
				whereas in Makkah as well as in Madinah, after the
				migration, there were many people who were in no way less
				inimical to Islam and the Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be
				Allah's peace and blessings) than Abu Lahab. The question
				is, what was the special trait of the character of this
				person, which became the basis of this condemnation by
				name? To understand that it is necessary that one should
				understand the Arabian society of that time and the role
				that Abu Lahab played in it.
			</p>
			<p>
				In ancient days since there prevailed chaos and
				confusion, bloodshed and plunder throughout Arabia, and
				the condition since centuries was that a person could
				have no guarantee of the protection of life, honor and
				property except with the help and support of his clansmen
				and blood relations, therefore silah rehmi (good
				treatment of the kindred) was esteemed most highly among
				the moral values of the Arabian society and breaking off
				of connections with the kindred was regarded as a great
				sin. Under the influence of the same Arabian tradition
				when the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) began to
				preach the message of Islam, the other clans of Quraish
				and their chiefs resisted and opposed him tooth and nail,
				but the Bani Hashim and the Bani al-Muttalib (children of
				al-Muttalib, brother of Hashim) not only did not oppose
				him but continued to support him openly, although most of
				them had not yet believed in his Prophethood. The other
				clans of Quraish themselves regarded this support by the
				blood relations of the Holy Prophet as perfectly in
				accordance with the moral traditions of Arabia. That is
				why they never taunted the Bani Hashim and the Bani
				al-Muttalib in that they had abandoned their ancestral
				faith by supporting a person who was preaching a new
				faith. They knew and believed that they could in no case
				hand over an individual of their clan to his enemies, and
				their support and aid of a clansman was perfectly natural
				in the sight of the Quraish and the people of Arabia.
			</p>
			<p>
				This moral principle, which the Arabs even in the
				pre-Islamic days of ignorance, regarded as worthy of
				respect and inviolable was broken only by one man in his
				enmity of Islam, and that was Abu Lahab, son of Abdul
				Muttalib. He was an uncle of the Holy Prophet, whose
				father and he were sons of the same father. In Arabia, an
				uncle represented the father especially when the nephew
				was fatherless. The uncle was expected to look after the
				nephew as one of his own children. But this man in his
				hostility to Islam and love of kufr trampled all the Arab
				traditions underfoot.
			</p>
			<p>
				The traditionists have related from Ibn Abbas with
				several chains of transmitters the tradition that when
				the Holy Prophet was commanded to present the message of
				Islam openly, and he was instructed in the Quran to warn
				first of all his nearest kinsfolk of the punishment of
				God, he ascended the Mount Safa one morning and called
				out aloud: Ya sabahah (O, the calamity of the morning!).
				This alarm in Arabia was raised by the person who noticed
				early at dawn an enemy tribe advancing against his tribe.
				When the Holy Messenger made this call, the people
				inquired as to who had made the call. They were told that
				it was Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace). Thereat the
				people of all the clans of Quraish rushed out. Everyone
				who could, came; he who could not, sent another one for
				himself. When the People had assembled, the Holy
				Messenger calling out each clan by name, viz. O Bani
				Hashim, O Bani Abdul Muttalib, O Bani Fir, O Bani so and
				so, said: "If I were to tell you that behind the hill
				there was an enemy host ready to fall upon you, would you
				believe me?" The people responded with one voice, saying
				that they never had so far experienced a lie from him.
				The Holy Prophet said: "Then I warn you that you are
				heading for a torment." Thereupon, before anyone else
				could speak, Abu Lahab, the Holy Prophet's uncle, said:
				"May you perish! Did you summon us for this?" Another
				tradition adds that he picked up a stone to throw at the
				Holy Prophet. (Musnad Ahmad, Bukhari, Muslim, Tirmidhi,
				Ibn Jarir, and others).
			</p>
			<p>
				According to Ibn Zaid, one day Abu Lahab asked the Holy
				Prophet: "If I were to accept your religion, what would I
				get?" The Holy Prophet replied: "You would get what the
				other believers would get." He said: "Is there no
				preference or distinction for me?" The Holy Prophet
				replied: "What else do you want?" Thereupon he said: "May
				this religion perish in which I and all other people
				should be equal and alike!" (Ibn Jarir).
			</p>
			<p>
				In Makkah Abu Lahab was the next door neighbor of the
				Holy Prophet. Their houses were separated by a wall.
				Besides him, Hakam bin As (Father of Marwan), Uqbah bin
				Abi Muait, Adi bin Hamra and Ibn al- Asda il-Hudhali also
				were his neighbors. These people did not allow him to
				have peace even in his own house. Sometimes when he was
				performing the Prayer, they would place the goat's
				stomach on him; sometimes when food was being cooked in
				the courtyard, they would throw filth at the cooking pot.
				The Holy Prophet would come out and say: "O Bani Abdi
				Manaf, what kind of neighborliness is it?" Abu Lahab's
				wife, Umm Jamil (Abu Sufyan's sister), had made it a
				practice to cast thorns at his door in the night so that
				when he or his children came out of the house at dawn,
				they should run thorns in the foot. (Baihaqi, Ibn Abi
				Hatim, Ibn Jarir, Ibn Asakir, Ibn Hisham).
			</p>
			<p>
				Before the proclamation of Prophethood, two of the Holy
				Prophet's daughters were married to two of Abu Lahab's
				sons, Utbah and Utaibah. After his call when the Holy
				Prophet began to invite the people to Islam, Abu Lahab
				said to both his sons: "I would forbid myself seeing and
				meeting you until you divorced the daughters of Muhammad
				(upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings)." So, both of
				them divorced their wives. Utaibah in particular became
				so nasty in his spitefulness that one day he came before
				the Holy Prophet and said: "I repudiate An-najmi idha haw
				and Alladhi dana fatadalla" and then he spat at him, but
				his spittle did not fall on him. The Holy Prophet prayed:
				"O God, subject him to the power of a dog from among Your
				dogs." Afterwards, Utaibah accompanied his father in his
				journey to Syria. During the journey the caravan halted
				at a place which, according to local people, was visited
				by wild beasts at night. Abu Lahab told his companions,
				the Quraish: "Make full arrangements for the protection
				of my son, for I fear the curse invoked by Muhammad (upon
				whom be Allah's peace) on him." Accordingly, the people
				made their camels sit all around Utaibah and went to
				sleep. At night a tiger came which crossed the circle of
				the camels and devoured Utaibah tearing him to pieces.
				(Ibn Abdul Barr: Al- Istiab; Ibn Hajar: Al-Isabah; Abu
				Nuaim al-Isfahani: Dalail an-Nubuwwat; As-Suhaili: Raud
				al-Unuf. Here there is a difference of opinion. Some
				reporters say that the divorce took place after the Holy
				Prophet's proclamation of Prophethood and some say that
				it took place after the revelation of Tabbat yada Abi
				Lahab. There is also a difference of opinion about
				whether Abu Lahab's this son was Utbah or Utaibah. But
				this much is confirmed: that after the conquest of
				Makkah, Utbah embraced Islam and took the oath of
				allegiance at the Holy Prophet's hand. Therefore, the
				correct view is that it was Utaibah).
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Lahab's wickedness can be judged from the fact that
				when after the death of the Holy Prophet's son Hadrat
				Qasim, his second son, Hadrat Abdullah, also died, this
				man instead of condoling with his nephew in his
				bereavement, hastened to the Quraish chiefs joyfully to
				give them the news that Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's
				peace and blessings) had become childless that night.
				This we have already related in the commentary of Surah
				Al-Kauthar.
			</p>
			<p>
				Wherever the Holy Prophet went to preach his message of
				Islam, this man followed him and forbade the people to
				listen to him. Rabiah bin Abbad ad-Dill has related: "I
				was a young boy when I accompanied my father to the face
				of Dhul-Majaz. There I saw the Holy Messenger (may peace
				be upon him) who was exhorting the people, saying: 'O
				people, say: there is no deity but Allah, you will attain
				success.' Following behind him I saw a man, who was
				telling the people; `This fellow is a liar: he has gone
				astray from his ancestral faith.' I asked; who is he? The
				people replied: He is his uncle, Abu Lahab." (Musnad
				Ahmad, Baihaqi). Another tradition from Hadrat Rabiah is
				to the effect; "I saw that the Holy Prophet went to the
				halting place of each tribe and said: `O children of so
				and so, I have been appointed Allah's Messenger to you. I
				exhort you to worship only Allah and to associate none
				with Him. So, affirm faith in me and join me so that I
				may fulfill the mission for which I have been sent.'
				Following close behind him there was a man who was
				saying: `O children of so and so, he is leading you
				astray from Lat and Uzza and inviting you to the religion
				of error and innovation which he has brought. Do not at
				all listen to what he says and do not follow him.' I
				asked my father: who is he? He replied: he is his uncle,
				Abu Lahab." (Musnad Ahmad, Tabarani). Tariq bin Abdullah
				al-Muharibi's tradition is similar. He says: "I saw in
				the fare of Dhul-Majaz that the Holy Messenger (upon whom
				be peace) was exhorting the people, saying: `O people,
				say La ilaha ill-Allah, you will attain success', and
				behind him there was a man who was casting stones at him,
				until his heels bled, and he was telling the people: 'Do
				not listen to him, he is a liar.' I asked the people who
				he was. They said he was his uncle, Abu Lahab."
				(Tirmidhi).
			</p>
			<p>
				In the 7th year of Prophethood, when all the clans of
				Quraish boycotted the Bani Hashim and the Bani al-
				Muttalib socially and economically, and both these clans
				remaining steadfast to the Holy Prophet's support, were
				besieged in Shib Abi Talib, Abu Lahab was the only
				person, who sided with the disbelieving Quraish against
				his own clan. This boycott continued for three years, so
				much so that the Bani Hashim and the Bani al- Muttalib
				began to starve. This, however, did not move Abu Lahab.
				When a trade caravan came to Makkah and a besieged person
				from Shib Abi Talib approached it to buy some article of
				food, Abu Lahab would shout out to the merchants to
				demand a forbidding price, telling them that he would
				make up for any loss that they incurred. Thus, they would
				demand exorbitant rates and the poor customer had to
				return empty handed to his starving children. Then Abu
				Lahab would purchase the same articles from them at the
				market rates. (Ibn Sa'd, Ibn Hisham).
			</p>
			<p>
				On account of these very misdeeds this man was condemned
				in this Surah by name, and there was a special need for
				it. When the Holy Prophet's own uncle followed and
				opposed him before the Arabs who came for hajj from
				outside Makkah, or gathered together in the fares held at
				different places, they regarded it as against the
				established traditions of Arabia that an uncle should run
				down his nephew without a reason, should pelt stones at
				him and bring false accusations against him publicly.
				They were, therefore, influenced by what Abu Lahab said
				and were involved in doubt about the Holy Prophet (upon
				whom be peace). But when this, Surah was revealed, and
				Abu Lahab, filled with rage, started uttering nonsense,
				the people realized that what he said in opposition to
				the Holy Prophet was not at all reliable, for he said all
				that in his mad hostility to his nephew.
			</p>
			<p>
				Besides, when his uncle was condemned by name, the
				people's expectation that the Holy Messenger (upon whom
				be peace) could treat some relative leniently in the
				matter of religion was frustrated for ever. When the Holy
				Messenger's own uncle was taken to task publicly the
				people understood that there was no room for preference
				or partiality in their faith. A non-relative could become
				a near and dear one if he believed, and a near relation a
				non-relative if he disbelieved. Thus, there is no place
				for the ties of blood in religion.

		<section heading="Name">
			<p>
				Al-Ikhlas is not merely the name of this Surah but also
				the title of its contents, for it deals exclusively with
				Tauhid. The other Surahs of the Quran generally have been
				designated after a word occurring in them, but in this
				Surah the word Ikhlas has occurred nowhere. It has been
				given this name in view of its meaning and subject
				matter. Whoever understands it and believes in its
				teaching, will get rid of shirk (polytheism) completely.

		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				Whether it is a Makki or a Madani Surah is disputed, and
				the difference of opinion has been caused by the
				traditions which have been related concerning the
				occasion of its revelation. We give them below ad
				seriatum:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Hadrat Abdullah bin Masud has reported that the
					Quraish said to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be be
					peace): "Tell us of the ancestry of your Lord."
					Thereupon this Surah was sent down. (Tabarani).
				</li>
				<li>
					Abul Aliyah has related on the authority of
					Hadrat Ubayy bin Kab that the polytheists said to
					the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace): Tell us of
					your Lord's ancestry. Thereupon Allah sent down
					this Surah. (Musnad Ahmad, Ibn Abi Harim, Ibn
					Jarir, Tirmidhi, Bukhari in At-Tarikh, Ibn
					al-Mundhir, Hakim, Baihaqi). Tirmidhi has related
					a tradition on the same theme from Abul Aliyah,
					which does not contain any reference to Hadrat
					Ubayy bin Kab, and has declared it to be more
					authentic.
				</li>
				<li>
					Hadrat Jabir bin Abdullah has stated that a
					bedouin (according to other traditions, some
					people) said to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
					peace): "Tell us of your Lord's
					ancestry."Thereupon Allah sent down this
					Surah.(Abu Yala, Ibn Jarir, Ibn al-Mundhir,
					Tabarani in Al-Ausat, Baihaqi, Abu Nuaim in
					Al-Hilyah).
				</li>
				<li>
					Ikrimah has related a tradition form Ibn Abbas,
					saying that a group of the Jews, including Kab
					bin Ashraf, Huyayy bin Akhtab and other, came
					before the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) and
					said: "O Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and
					blessings), tell us of the attributes of your
					Lord, Who has sent you as a Prophet." Thereupon
					Allah sent down this Surah. (Ibn Abi Hatim, Ibn
					Adi, Baihaqi in Al-Asma was-Sifat).
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				In addition to these, some other traditions also have
				been cited by Ibn Taimiyyali in his commentary of Surah
				Al-Ikhlas, which are as follows:
			</p>
			<p>
				These traditions show that different people on different
				occasions had questioned the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
				peace) about the essence and nature of the God to Whose
				service and worship he invited the people, and on every
				occasion he recited by Allah's command this very Surah in
				response. First of all, the pagans. of Quraish asked him
				this question in Makkah, and in reply this Surah was sent
				down. Then, at Madinah, sometimes the Christians, and
				sometimes the other people of Arabia, asked him questions
				of this nature, and every time Allah inspired him to
				recite this very Surah in answer to them. In each of
				these traditions, it has been said that this Surah was
				revealed on this or that occasion. From this one should
				not form the impression that all these traditions are
				mutually contradictory. The fact is that whenever there
				existed with the Holy Prophet a verse or a Surah
				previously revealed in respect of a particular question
				or matter, and later the same question was presented
				before him, Allah inspired him to recite the same verse
				or Surah to the people as it contained the answer to
				their question. The reporters of Hadith describe the same
				thing, saying: When such and such a question or matter
				was presented before the Holy Prophet, such and such a
				verse or Surah was revealed. This has also been described
				as repetition of revelation, i.e. the revelation of a
				verse or Surah several times.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thus, the fact is that this Surah is Makki, rather in
				view of its subject matter a Surah revealed in the
				earliest period at Makkah, when detailed verses of the
				Quran dealing with the essence and attributes of Allah
				Almighty had not yet been revealed, and the people
				hearing, the Holy Prophet's invitation to Allah, wanted
				to know what was his Lord like to whose worship and
				service he was calling them. Another proof of this
				Surah's being one of the earliest Surahs to be revealed
				is that when in Makkah Umayyah bin Khalaf, the master of
				Hadrat Bilal, made him lie down on burning sand and
				placed a heavy stone on his chest, Bilal used to cry
				"Ahad, Ahad!" This word was derived from this very Surah.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject Matter">
			<p>
				A little consideration of the traditions regarding the
				occasion of the revelation of this Surah shows what were
				the religious concepts of the world at the time the Holy
				Prophet began to preach the message of Tauhid. The
				idolatrous polytheists were worshipping gods made of
				wood, stone, gold, silver and other substances. These
				gods had a form, shape and body. The gods and goddesses
				were descended from each other. No goddess was without a
				husband and no god without a wife. They stood in need of
				food and drink and their devotees arranged these for
				them. A large number of the polytheists believed that God
				assumed human form and there were some people who
				descended from Him. Although the Christians claimed to
				believe in One God, yet their God also had at least a
				son, and besides the Father and Son, the Holy Ghost also
				had the honor of being an associate in Godhead: so much
				so that God had a mother and a mother-in-law too. The
				Jews also claimed to believe in One God, but their God
				too was not without physical, material and other human
				qualities and characteristics. He went for a stroll,
				appeared in human form, wrestled with a servant of His,
				and was father of a son, Ezra. Besides these religious
				communities, the zoroastrianism were fire worshipers, and
				the Sabeans star worshipers. Under such conditions when
				the people were invited to believe in Allah, the One; Who
				has no associate, it was inevitable that questions arose
				in the minds as to what kind of a God it was, Who was one
				and Only Lord and invitation to believe in Whom was being
				given at the expense of all other gods and deities. It is
				a miracle of the Quran that in a few words briefly it
				answered all the questions and presented such a clear
				concept of the Being of Allah as destroyed all
				polytheistic concepts, without leaving any room for the
				ascription of any of the human qualities to His Being.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Merit and Importance">
			<p>
				That is why the Holy Messenger of Allah (upon whom be
				peace) held this Surah in great esteem, and he made the
				Muslims realize its importance in different ways so that
				they recited it frequently and disseminated it among the
				people. For it states the foremost and fundamental
				doctrine of Islam (viz. Tauhid) in four such brief
				sentences as are immediately impressed on human memory
				and can be read and recited easily. There are a great
				number of the traditions of Hadith, which show that the
				Holy Prophet on different occasions and in different ways
				told the people that this Surah is equivalent to
				one-third of the Quran. Several hadith on this subject
				have been related in Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Daud; Nasai,
				Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, Musnad Ahmad, Tabarani and other
				books, on the authority of Abu Said Khudri, Abu Hurairah,
				Abu Ayyub Ansari, Abu ad-Darda, Muadh bin Jabal, Jabir
				bin Abdullah, Ubayy bin Kab, Umm Kulthum bint Uqbah bin
				Abi Muait, Ibn Umar, Ibn Masud, Qatadah bin an-Numan,
				Anas bin Malik, and Abu Masud (may Allah be pleased with
				all of them). The commentators have given many
				explanations of the Holy Prophet's saying this. But in
				our opinion it simply means that the religion presented
				by the Quran is based on three doctrines: Tauhid,
				Apostleship and the Hereafter. This Surah teaches Tauhid,
				pure and undefiled. Therefore, the Holy Prophet (upon
				whom he Peace) regarded it as equal to one-third of the
				Quran.
			</p>
			<p>
				A tradition on the authority of Hadrat Aishah has been
				related in Bukhari, Muslim and other collections of the
				hadith, saying that the Holy Prophet sent a man as leader
				of an expedition. During the journey he concluded his
				recitation of the Quran in every Prayer with Qul
				Huwa-Allahu ahad. On their return him companions
				mentioned this before the Holy Prophet. He said: "Ask him
				why he did so." When the man was asked, he replied: "In
				this Surah the attributes of the Merciful God have been
				stated; therefore, I love to recite it again and again."
				When the Holy Prophet heard this reply, he said to the
				people: "Inform him that Allah holds him in great love
				and esteem."
			</p>
			<p>
				A similar incident has been related in Bukhari, on the
				authority of Hadrat Anas. He says: "A man from among the
				Ansar led the Prayers in the Quba Mosque. His practice
				was that in every rakah he first recited this Surah and
				then would join another Surah to it. The people objected
				to it and said to him: 'Don't you think that Surah Ikhlas
				is by itself enough? Why do you join another Surah to it?
				You should either recite only this surah, or should leave
				it and recite some other Surah'. He said: 'I cannot leave
				it, I would rather give up leadership in the Prayer, if
				you so desired'. The people did not approve that another
				man be appointed leader instead of him. At last, the
				matter was brought before the Holy Prophet. He asked the
				man, 'What prevents you from conceding what your
				companions desire? What makes you recite this particular
				Surah in every rakah?' The man replied: 'I have great
				love for it.' The Holy Prophet remarked: 'Your this love
				for this Surah has earned you entry into Paradise'."

				Although these two Surahs of the Quran are separate
				entities and are written in the Mushaf also under
				separate names, yet they are so deeply related mutually
				and their contents so closely resemble each other's that
				they have been designated by a common name Mu'awwidhatayn
				(the two Surahs in which refuge with Allah has been
				sought).  Imam Baihaqi in Dala'il an-Nubuwwat has written
				that these Surahs were revealed together, that is why the
				combined name of both is Mu'awwidhatayn.  We are writing
				the same one Introduction to both, for they discuss and
				deal with just the same matters and topics.  However,
				they will be explained and commented on separately below.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				Hadrat Hasan Basri, 'Ikrimah, 'Ata' and Jabir bin Zaid
				say that these Surahs are Makki.  A tradition from Hadrat
				'Abdullah bin 'Abbas also supports the same view. 
				However, according to another tradition from him, it is
				Madani and the same view is held also by Hadrat 'Abdullah
				bin Zubair and Qatadah.  One of the traditions which
				strengthens this second view is the Hadith which Muslim,
				Tirmidhi, Nasa'i and Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal have related
				on the authority of Hadrat 'Uqbah bin 'Amir.  He says
				that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peach) one day said
				to him:  "Do you know what kind of verses have been
				revealed to me tonight? - these matchless verses are
				A'udhu bi-Rabbil-falaq and A'udhu bi-Rabbin-nas.  This
				Hadith is used as an argument for these Surahs to be
				Madani because Hadrat 'Uqbah bin 'Amir had become a
				Muslim in Madinah after the hijrah, as related by Abu
				Da'ud and Nasa'i on the basis of his own statement. 
				Other traditions which have lent strength to this view
				are those related by Ibn Sa'd, Muhiyy-us-Sunnah Baghawi,
				Imam Nasafi, Imam Baihaqi, Hafiz Ibn Hajar, Hafiz
				Badr-uddin 'Ayni, 'Abd bin Humaid and others to the
				effect that these Surahs were revealed when the Jews had
				worked magic on the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) in
				Madinah and he had fallen ill under its effect.  Ibn Sa'd
				has related on the authority of Waqidi that this happened
				in A.H. 7.  On this very basis Sufyan bin Uyainah also
				has described these Surah as Madani.
			</p>
			<p>
				But as we have explained in the Introduction to Surah
				Al-Ikhlas, when it is said about a certain Surah or verse
				that it was revealed on this or that particular occasion,
				it does not necessarily mean that it was revealed for the
				first time on that very occasion.  Rather it sometimes so
				happened that a Surah or a verse had previously been
				revealed, then on the occurrence or appearance of a
				particular incident or situation, the Holy Prophet's
				attention was drawn to it by Allah for the second time,
				or even again and again.  In our opinion the same also
				was the case with the Mu'awwidhatayn.  The subject matter
				of these Surahs is explicit that these were sent down at
				Makkah in the first instance when opposition to the Holy
				Prophet there had grown very intense.  Later, when at
				Madinah storms of opposition were raised by the
				hypocrites, Jews and polytheists, the Holy Prophet was
				instructed to recite these very Surahs, as has been
				mentioned in the above cited tradition from Hadrat Uqbah
				bin Amir.  After this, when magic was worked on him, and
				his illness grew intense, Gabriel came and instructed him
				by Allah's command to recite these very Surahs. 
				Therefore, in our opinion, the view held by the
				commentators who describe both these Surahs as Makki is
				more reliable.	Regarding them as connected exclusively
				with the incident of magic is difficult, for to this
				incident related only one verse (v.4), the remaining
				verses of Surah al Falaq and the whole of Surah An-Nas
				have nothing to do with it directly.

		<section heading="Theme and Subject-Matter">
			<p>
				The conditions under which these two Surahs were sent
				down in Makkah were as follows.  As soon as the Holy
				Prophet (upon whom be peace) began to preach the message
				of Islam, it seemed as though he had provoked all classes
				of the people around him.  As his message spread the
				opposition of the disbelieving Quraish also became more
				and more intense.  As long as they had any hope that they
				would be able to prevent him from preaching his message
				by throwing some temptation in his way, or striking some
				bargain with him, their hostility did not become very
				active.  But when the Holy Prophet disappointed them
				completely that he would not effect any kind of
				compromise with them in the matter of faith, and in Surah
				Al-Kafirun they were plainly told: "I do not worship
				those who you worship nor are you worshipers of Him Whom
				I worship.  For you is your religion and for me is mine",
				the hostility touched its extreme limits.  More
				particularly, the families whose members (men or women,
				boys or girls) had accepted Islam, were burning with rage
				from within against the Holy Prophet.  They were cursing
				him, holding secret consultations to kill him quietly in
				the dark of the night so that the Bani Hashim could not
				discover the murderer and take revenge; magic and charms
				were being worked on him so as to cause his death, or
				make him fall ill, or become mad; satans from among the
				men and the jinn spread on every side so as to whisper
				one or another evil into the hearts of the people against
				him and the Quran brought by him so that they became
				suspicious of him and fled him.  There were many people
				who were burning with jealousy against him, for they
				could not tolerate that a man from another family or clan
				than their own should flourish and become prominent.  For
				instance, the reason why Abu Jahl was crossing every
				limit in his hostility to him has been explained by
				himself: "We and the Bani Abdi Manaf (to which the Holy
				Prophet belonged) were rivals of each other: they fed
				others, we too fed others; they provided conveyances to
				the people, we too did the same; they gave donations, we
				too gave donations, so much so that when they and we have
				become equal in honor and nobility, they now proclaim
				that they have a Prophet who is inspired from the heaven;
				how can we compete with them in this field?  By God, we
				will never acknowledge him, nor affirm faith in him".
				(Ibn Hisham, vol. I, pp. 337-338).
			</p>
			<p>
				Such were the conditions when the Holy Prophet (upon whom
				be peace) was commanded to tell the people: "I seek
				refuge with the Lord of the dawn, from the evil of
				everything that He has created, and from the evil of the
				darkness of night and from the evil of magicians, men and
				women, and from the evil of the envious", and to tell
				them: "I seek refuge with the Lord of mankind, the King
				of mankind, and the Deity of mankind, from the evil of
				the whisperer, who returns over and over again, who
				whispers (evil) into the hearts of men, whether he be
				from among the jinn or men."  This is similar to what the
				Prophet Moses had been told to say when Pharaoh had
				expressed his design before his full court to kill him:
				"I have taken refuge with my Lord and your Lord against
				every arrogant person who does not believe in the Day of
				Reckoning." (Al-Mu'min: 27).  And: "I have taken refuge
				with my Lord and your Lord lest you should assail me."
				(Ad-Dukhan;20).
			</p>
			<p>
				On both occasions these illustrious Prophets of Allah
				were confronted with well-equipped, resourceful and
				powerful enemies.  On both occasions they stood firm on
				their message of Truth against their strong opponents,
				whereas they had no material power on the strength of
				which they could fight them, and on both occasions they
				utterly disregarded the threats and dangerous plans and
				hostile devices of the enemy, saying: "We have taken
				refuge with the Lord of the universe against you."
				Obviously, such firmness and steadfastness can be shown
				only by the person who has the conviction that the power
				of His Lord is the supreme power, that all powers of the
				world are insignificant against Him, and that no one can
				harm the one who has taken His refuge.	Only such a one
				can say: "I will not give up preaching the Word of Truth.
				 I care the least for what you may say or do, for I have
				taken refuge with my Lord and your Lord and Lord of all
				universe."

		</section>
		<section heading="Question whether Mu'awwidhatayn are, or are not, Quranic">
			<p>
				The above discussion is enough to help one understand
				fully the theme and content of the two Surahs, but since
				three points in the books of Hadith and commentary
				concerning these Surahs have been discussed, which are
				likely to create doubts in the minds, it is necessary to
				clear them also here.
			</p>
			<p>
				First, whether it is absolutely established that these
				two Surahs are the Quranic Surahs, or whether there is
				some doubt in this regard.  This question arose because
				in the traditions related from an illustrious Companion
				like Hadrat Abdullah bin Mas'ud, it has been said that he
				did not regard these two Surahs as the Surahs of the
				Quran and had eliminated these from his copy of the
				Mushaf.  Imam Ahmad, Bazzar, Tabarani, Ibn Marduyah, Abu
				Ya'la, Abdullah bin Ahmad bin Hanbal, Humaydi, Abu
				Nu'aim, Ibn Hibban and other traditionists have related
				this from Hadrat Abdullah bin Mas'ud with different
				chains of transmitters and mostly on sound authority. 
				According to these traditions, he not only eliminated
				these Surahs from the Mushaf but it has also been
				reported that he used to say: "Do not mix up with the
				Quran that which is not of the Quran.  These two Surahs
				are not included in the Quran.	This was only a command
				enjoined on the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) for
				seeking God's refuge." In some traditions there is also
				the addition that he did not recite these Surahs in the
				Prayer.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the basis of these traditions the opponents of Islam
				had an opportunity to raise doubts about the Quran,
				saying that this Book, God forbid, is not free from
				corruption.  For when, according to a Companion of the
				rank of Hadrat Abdullah bin Mas'ud, these two Surahs are
				an annexation to the Quran, many other additions and
				subtractions also might have been made in it.  To rid the
				Quran of this blame Qadi Abu Bakr Al-Baqillani, Qadi Iyad
				and others took the stand that Ibn Mas'ud was not in fact
				a denier of the Mu'awwidhatayn being Quranic but only
				refused to write them in the Mushaf.  For, according to
				him, only that which the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
				peace) had allowed, should be written in the Mushaf, and
				Ibn Mas'ud did not receive the information that the Holy
				Prophet had allowed this.  But this stand is not correct,
				for according to sound evidence, it is confirmed that Ibn
				Mas'ud (may Allah be pleased with him) had denied that
				these were Surahs of the Quran.  Some other scholars, for
				instance, Imam Nawawi, Imam Ibn Hazm and Imam
				Fakhr-udding Razi, regard this as a pure lie and
				falsehood that Ibn Mas'ud had asserted any such thing. 
				But to reject genuine historical facts without sound
				evidence is unscientific.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, the question is:  How can the blame that attaches to
				the Quran because of these traditions of Ibn Mas'ud
				correctly refuted?  This question has several answers
				which we shall give below in sequence:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Hafiz Bazzar after relating these traditions of
					Ibn Mas'ud in his Musnad, has written that he is
					solitary and isolated in his this opinion; no one
					from among the Companions has supported this
					view.
				</li>
				<li>
					The copies of the Quran which the third Caliph,
					Hadrat Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him),
					had got compiled by the consensus of the
					Companions and which he had sent from the Islamic
					Caliphate officially to the centers of the world
					of Islam contained both these Surahs.
				</li>
				<li>
					The Mushaf which, since the sacred time of the
					Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) till today, has
					the seal of consensus of the entire world of
					Islam, contains both these Surahs.  The solitary
					opinion of only Abdullah bin Mas'ud, in spite of
					his high rank, has no weight against this great
					consensus.
				</li>
				<li>
					It is confirmed by sound and reliable hadith from
					the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) that he not
					only recited these Surahs in the Prayer himself
					but instructed others also to recite them, and
					taught them to the people as the Surahs of the
					Quran.	Consider, for instance, the following
					hadith:
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				We have cited on the authority of Muslim, Ahmad, Tirmidhi
				and Nasai the tradition of Hadrat Uqbah bin Amir that the
				Holy Prophet told him about Surah Al-Falaq and Surah
				An-Nas, saying that those verses had been revealed to him
				that night.  A tradition in Nasai from Uqbah bin Amir is
				to the effect that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
				recited both these Surahs in the Morning Prayer.  Imam
				Ahmad on sound authority has related in his Musnad the
				tradition from a Companion that the Holy Prophet said to
				him, "When you perform the Prayer, recite both these
				Surahs in it."	In Musnad Ahmad, Abu Daud and Nasai this
				tradition of Uqbah bin Amir has been related: "The Holy
				Prophet said to him: Should I not teach you two such
				Surahs as are among the best Surahs that the people
				recite?  He said: Do teach me, O Messenger of Allah. 
				Thereupon the Holy Prophet taught him the Mu'awwidhatayn.
				 Then the Prayer began and the Holy Prophet recited the
				same two Surahs in it also, and when after the Prayer the
				Holy Prophet passed by him, he said to him, 'O Uqbah, how
				did you like it?'  Then he instructed him to the effect:
				When you go to bed, and when you get up from bed, recite
				these Surahs."	In Musnad Ahmad, Abu Da'ud, Tirmidhi and
				Nasa'i there is a tradition from Uqbah bin Amir, saying
				that the Holy Prophet exhorted him to recite the
				Mu'awwidhat (i.e. Qul Huwa Allahu ahad and the
				Mu'awwidhatayn) after every Prayer.  Nasai, Ibn Marduyah
				and Hakim have related this tradition also from Uqbah bin
				Amir: "Once the Holy Prophet was riding on a conveyance
				and I was walking along with him with my hand placed on
				his sacred foot.  I said: Kindly teach me Surah Hud or
				Surah Yusuf.  He replied: In the sight of Allah there is
				nothing more beneficial for the servant than Qul a'udhu
				bi-Rabbil-falaq."  A tradition from Abdullah bin Abid
				al-Juhani has been related by Nasai, Baihaqi and Ibn Sad,
				saying that the Holy Prophet said to him: "Ibn Abid,
				should I not tell you what are the best things out of the
				means by which the seekers of refuge have sought refuge
				with Allah?  I submitted: Do teach me, O Messenger of
				Allah.	He replied: Qul a'udhu bi-Rabbil-falaq and Qul
				a-udhu bi Rabbin-nas - both these Surahs."  Ibn Marduyah
				had related from Hadrat Umm Salamah: "The Surahs best
				liked by Allah are: Qul a'udhu bi-Rabbil-falaq and Qul
				a'udhu bi-Rabbin-nas."
			</p>
			<p>
				Here, the question arises: what caused Hadrat Abdullah
				bin Mas'ud the misunderstanding that these two are not
				Surahs of the Quran?  We get the answer to it when we
				combine two traditions: first, that Hadrat Abdullah bin
				Mas'ud asserted that this was only a command which the
				Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) was given to teach him
				the method of seeking refuge with Allah; second, the
				tradition which Imam Bukhari has related in his Sahih,
				Imam Ahmad in his Musnad, Hafiz Abu Bakr al-Humaidi in
				his Musnad, Abu Nu'aim in his Al-Mustakhraj and Nasai in
				his Sunan, with different chains of transmitters, on the
				authority of Zirr bin Hubaish, with a slight variation in
				wording from Hadrat Ubayy bin Kab, who held a
				distinguished place among the Companions on the basis of
				his knowledge of the Quran.  Zirr bin Hubaish states: "I
				said to Hadrat Ubayy: Your brother, Abdullah bin Mas'ud,
				says these things.  What do you say about this view?  He
				replied: I had questioned the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
				peace) about this.  He said to me: I was told to say
				'qul', so I said 'qul'.  Therefore, we too say the same
				as the Holy Prophet said."  In the tradition related by
				Imam Ahmad, Hadrat Ubayy's words are to the effect: "I
				bear witness that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
				told me that Gabriel (peace be on him) had told him to
				say: Qul a'udhu bi-Rabbil-falaq; therefore, he recited
				likewise, and Gabriel asked him to say: Qul a'udhu
				bi-Rabbin-nas; therefore he too said likewise.	Hence, we
				too say as the Holy Prophet said."  A little
				consideration of these two traditions will show that the
				word qul (say) in the two Surahs caused Hadrat Abdullah
				bin Mas'ud the misunderstanding that the Holy Prophet
				(upon whom be peace) had been commanded to say: A'udhu
				bi-Rabbil-falaq and A'udhu bi-Rabbin-nas.  But he did not
				feel any need to question the Holy Prophet about it.  In
				the mind of Hadrat Ubbay bin Kab also a question arose
				about his and he put it before the Holy Prophet.  The
				Holy Prophet replied: "Since Gabriel (peace be on him)
				had said qul, so I too say qul."  Let us put it like
				this.  If somebody is commanded and asked: "Say, I seek
				refuge", he will not carry out the command, saying: "Say,
				I seek refuge", but he will drop the word "say" and say:
				"I seek refuge."  On the contrary, if the messenger of a
				superior officer conveys to somebody the message in these
				words: "Say, I seek refuge", and this command is given to
				him not only for his own person but to be conveyed to
				others, he will convey the words of the message verbatim
				to the people, and will not have the permission to drop
				anything from the text of the message.	Thus, the fact
				that these two Surahs begin with the word qul is a clear
				proof that it is Divine Word, which the Holy Prophet
				(upon whom be peace) was bound to convey verbatim.  It
				was not merely a command given to him for his person. 
				Besides these two Surahs, there are 330 other verses in
				the Quran which begin with the word qul (say).	The
				presence of qul in all these is a proof that it is Divine
				Word. which was obligatory for the Holy Prophet to convey
				verbatim; otherwise if qul everywhere had meant a
				command, the Holy Prophet would have dropped it and said
				only that which he was commanded to say, and it would not
				have been recorded in the Quran, but, on the contrary, he
				would have remained content with saying only what he was
				commanded to say.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here, if one considers this, one can understand fully
				well how unreasonable it is to regard the Companions as
				infallible and to make the clamor that a Companion has
				been defamed as soon as one hears a saying or doing of
				his being described as wrong.  Here, one can clearly see
				what a blunder happened to be committed by an illustrious
				Companion like Hadrat Abdullah bin Mas'ud about two
				Surahs of the Quran.  If such an error could be committed
				by an eminent Companion like him, others also might
				commit an error.  We can examine it in the scientific
				way, and describe it as wrong if a thing said or done by
				a Companion is proved to be wrong.  But wicked indeed
				would be the person who went beyond describing a wrong
				act as wrong and started reproving and finding fault with
				the Companions of the Holy Prophet of Allah.  Concerning
				the Mu'awwidhatayn the commentators and traditionists
				have described the opinion of Ibn Mas'ud as wrong, but no
				one has dared to say that by denying these two Surahs of
				the Quran, he had, God forbid, become a disbeliever.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Question of Holy Prophet's being affected by Magic">
			<p>
				The second thing that has arisen in respect of these two
				Surahs is that, according to traditions, magic had been
				worked on the Holy Prophet, and he had fallen ill under
				its effect, and Gabriel (peace be on him) had instructed
				him to repeat these Surahs to remove the charm.  This has
				been objected to by many rationalists of both ancient and
				modern times.  They say that if these traditions are
				accepted, the whole Shari'ah becomes doubtful.	For if
				the Prophet could be charmed, and according to these
				traditions he was charmed, one cannot say what the
				Prophet might have been made to say and do under the
				influence of magic by his opponents, and what in his
				teaching may be Divine and what the result of magic.  Not
				only this: they also allege that if this is accepted as
				true, it might well be that the Prophet might have been
				prompted to make the claim to Prophethood through magic
				and the Prophet by misunderstanding might have thought
				that an angel had come to him.	They also argue that
				these traditions clash with the Quran.	The Quran
				mentions the accusation of the disbelievers who said that
				the Prophet was bewitched (Bani Israel:47), but these
				traditions confirm the accusation of the disbelievers
				that the Prophet had actually been charmed and bewitched.
			</p>
			<p>
				For a proper investigation of this question it is
				necessary that one should first see whether it is
				established by authentic historical evidence that the
				Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) had actually been
				affected by magic, and if so, what it was and to what
				extent.  Then it should be seen whether the objections
				raised against what is established historically do
				actually apply to it or not.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Muslim scholars of the earliest period were truly
				honest and upright in that they did not try to corrupt
				history or conceal facts according to their own ideas,
				concepts and assumptions.  They conveyed intact to the
				later generations whatever was confirmed historically,
				and did not at all care how the material supplied by them
				could be used by the one who was bent upon drawing
				perverse conclusions from the facts.  Now, if something
				stands confirmed by authentic and historical means, it is
				neither right for an honest and rightminded person that
				he should deny history on the ground that in case he
				accepted it, it would lead to these evil results
				according to his thinking, nor it is right that he should
				add to and stretch beyond its genuine limits by
				conjecture and speculation whatever is established
				historically.  Instead, he should accept history as
				history and then see what is actually proved by it and
				what is not.
			</p>
			<p>
				As far as the historical aspect is concerned, the
				incident of the Holy Prophet's being affected by magic is
				absolutely confirmed, and if it can be refuted by
				scientific criticism, then no historical event of the
				world can be proved right and genuine.	It has been
				related by Bukhari, Muslim, Nasai, Ibn Majah, Imam Ahmad,
				Abdur Razzaq, Humaidi, Baihaqi, Tabarani, Ibn Sad, Ibn
				Mardayah, Ibn Abi Shaibah, Hakim, Abd bin Humaid and
				other traditionists on the authority of Hadrat Aishah,
				Hadrat Zaid bin Arqam and Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas,
				through so many different and numerous channels that
				forgery is out of the question.  Although each tradition
				by itself is an isolated report (khabar wahid), we give
				it below as a connected event from the details provided
				by the traditions.
			</p>
			<p>
				After the peace treaty of Hudaibiyah when the Holy
				Prophet (upon whom be peace) returned to Madinah, a
				deputation of the Jews of Khaiber visited Madinah in
				Muharram, A.H. 7 and met a famous magician, Labid bin
				Asam, who belonged to the Ansar tribe of Bani Zurayq. 
				They said to him: "You know how Muhammad (upon whom be
				Allah's peace and blessings) has treated us.  We have
				tried our best to bewitch him but have not succeeded. 
				Now we have come to you because you are a more skilled
				magician.  Here are three gold coins, accept these and
				cast a powerful magic spell on Muhammad."  In those days
				the Holy Prophet had a Jewish boy as his attendant. 
				Through him they obtained a piece of the Holy Prophet's
				comb with some hair stuck to it.  Magic was worked on the
				same hair and the teeth of the comb.  According to some
				traditions, magic was worked by Labid bin Asam himself;
				according to others, his sisters were more skilled than
				him and he got the spell cast through them.  Whatever be
				the case, Labid placed this spell in the spathe of a male
				date-tree and his it under a stone at the bottom of
				Dharwan or Dhi Arwan, the well of Bani Zurayq.	The spell
				took one whole year to have effect upon the Holy Prophet
				(upon whom be peace).  In the latter half of the year the
				Holy Prophet started feeling as if was unwell.	The last
				forty days became hard on him, of which the last three
				days were even harder.	But its maximum effect on him was
				that he way melting away from within.  He thought he had
				done a thing whereas, in fact, he had not done it: he
				thought he had visited his wives whereas he had not
				visited them; and sometimes he would doubt having seen
				something whereas, in fact, he had not seen it.  All
				these effects were confined to his own person; so much so
				that the other people could not notice what state he was
				passing through.  As for his being a Prophet, no change
				occurred in the performance of his duties.  There is no
				tradition to say that he might have forgotten some verses
				of the Quran in those days, or might have recited a verse
				wrongly, or a change might have occurred in the
				assemblies and in his counsels and sermons, or he might
				have presented a discourse as Revelation which may not
				have been revealed to him, or he might have missed a
				Prayer and thought that he had performed it.  God forbid,
				if any such thing had happened, it would have caused a
				clamor and the whole of Arabia would have known that a
				magician had overpowered the one whom no power had been
				able to overpower.  But the Holy Prophet's position as a
				Prophet remained wholly unaffected by it.  Only in his
				personal life he remained worried on account of it.  At
				last, one day when he was in the house of Hadrat Aishah,
				he prayed to Allah to be restored to full health.  In the
				meantime he fell asleep or drowsed and on waking he said
				to Hadrat Aishah: "My Lord has told me what I had asked
				of Him."  Hadrat Aishah asked what it was.  He replied:
				"Two men (i.e. two angels in human guise) came to me. 
				One sat near my head and the other near my feet.  The
				first asked: what has happened to him?	The other
				replied: Magic has been worked on him.	The first asked:
				who has worked it?  He replied: Labid bin Asam.  He
				asked: In what is it contained?  He replied: In the comb
				and hair covered in the spathe of a male date-tree.  He
				asked: where is it?  He replied: under a stone at the
				bottom of Dhi Arwan (or Dharwan), the well of Bani
				Zurayq.  He asked: what should be done about it?  He
				replied: the well should be emptied and it should be
				taken out from under the stone.  The Holy Prophet then
				sent Hadrat Ali, Hadrat Ammar bin Yasir and Hadrat
				Zubair: They were also joined by Jubair bin Iyas az-Zurqi
				(two men from Bani Zurayq).  Later the Holy Prophet also
				arrived at the well along with some Companions.  The
				water was taken out and the spathe recovered.  There they
				found that beside the comb and hair there was a cord with
				eleven knots on it and a wax image with needles pricked
				into it.  Gabriel (peace be on him) came and told him to
				repeat the Mu'awwidhatayn.  As he repeated verse after 
			</p>
			<p>
				verse, a knot was loosened and a needle taken out every
				time, till on finishing the last words all the knots were
				loosened and all the needles removed, and he was entirely
				freed from the charm.  After this he called Labid and
				questioned him.  He confessed his guilt and the Holy
				Prophet let him go, for he never avenged himself on
				anyone for any harm done to his person.  He even declined
				to talk about it to others, saying that Allah had
				restored him to health; therefore he did not like that he
				should incite the people against anyone.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is the story of the magic worked on the Holy
				Prophet.  There is nothing in it which might run counter
				to his office of Prophethood.  In his personal capacity
				if any injury could be inflicted on him as it happened in
				the Battle of Uhud, if he could fall from his horse and
				be hurt as is confirmed by the Hadith, if he could be
				stung by a scorpion as has been mentioned in some
				Traditions and none of these negates the protection
				promised him by Allah in his capacity as a Prophet, he
				could also fall ill under the influence of magic in his
				personal capacity.  That a Prophet can be affected by
				magic is also confirmed by the Quran.  In Surah Al-A'raf
				it has been said about the magicians of Pharaoh that when
				they confronted the Prophet Moses, they bewitched the
				eyes of thousands of people who had assembled to witness
				the encounter (v. 116).  In Surah Ta Ha it has been said
				that not only the common people but the Prophet Moses too
				felt that the cords and staffs that they cast were
				running towards them like so many snakes, and this filled
				Moses' heart with fear.  Thereupon Allah revealed to him:
				"Don't fear for you will come out victorious.  Cast down
				you staff." (vv. 66-69).  As for the objection that this
				then confirms the accusation of the disbelievers of
				Makkah that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) was a
				bewitched man, its answer is that the disbelievers did
				not call him a bewitched man in the sense that he had
				fallen ill under that effect of magic cast by somebody,
				but in the sense that some magician has, God forbid, made
				him mad, and he had made claim to Prophethood and was
				telling the people tales of Hell and Heaven in his same
				madness.  Now, obviously this objection does not at all
				apply to a matter about which history confirms that the
				magic spell had affected only the person of Muhammad
				(upon whom be peace) and not the Prophethood of Muhammad
				(upon whom be peace), which remained wholly unaffected by
				it.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this connection, another thing worthy of mention is
				that the people who regard magic as a kind of
				superstition hold this view only because the effect of
				magic cannot be explained scientifically.  But there are
				many things in the world which one experiences and
				observes but one cannot explain scientifically how they
				happen.  If we cannot give any such explanation it does
				not become necessary that we should deny the thing itself
				which we cannot explain.  Magic, in fact, is a
				psychological phenomenon which can affect the body
				through the mind just as physical things affect the mind
				through the body.  Fear, for instance, is a psychological
				phenomenon, but it affects the body: the hair stand on
				end and the body shudders.  Magic does not; in fact,
				change the reality, but under its influence man's mind
				and senses start feeling as if reality had changed.  The
				staffs and the cords that the magicians had thrown
				towards the Prophet Moses, had not actually become
				snakes, but the eyes of the multitude of people were so
				bewitched that everybody felt they were snakes; even the
				senses of the Prophet Moses could not remain unaffected
				by the magic spell.  Likewise, in Al-Baqarah: 102, it has
				been said that in Babylon people learnt such matic from
				Harut and Marut as could cause division between husband
				and wife.  This too was a psychological phenomenon. 
				Obviously, if the people did not find it officacious by
				experience they could not become its customers.  No
				doubt, it is correct that just like the bullet of the
				rifle and the bomb from the aircraft, magic too cannot
				have effect without Allah's permission, but it would be
				mere stubbornness to deny a thing which has been
				experienced and observed by man for thousands for years.

		<section heading="Question of Reciting Charms and Amulets in Islam">
			<p>
				The third thing that arises in connection with these
				Surahs is whether recitation of charms and amulets has
				any place in Islam, and whether such recitation is by
				itself efficacious or not.  This question arises for in
				many hadith it has been reported that the Holy Prophet
				(upon whom be peace) at the time of going to bed every
				night, especially during illness, used to recite the
				Mu'awwidhatayn (or according to other reports, the
				Mu'awwidhat, i.e. Qul Huwa-Allahu Ahad and the
				Mu'awwidhatayn) thrice, blow in his hands and then rub
				the hands on his body from head to foot as far as his
				hands could reach.  During his last illness when it was
				not longer possible for him to so do, Hadrat Aishah
				recited these Surahs herself or by his command blew on
				his hands hin view of their being blessed and rubbed them
				on his body.  Traditions on this subject have been
				related in Bukhari, Muslim, Nasai, Ibn Majah, Abu Da'ud
				and Mu'atta of Imam Malik through authentic channels on
				the authority of Hadrat Aishah herself beside whom no one
				could be better acquainted with the domestic life of the
				Holy Prophet.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this regard, one should first understand its religious
				aspect.  In the Hadith a lengthy tradition has been
				related on the authority of Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas, at
				the end of which the Holy Prophet is reported to have
				said: "The people of my Ummah to enter Paradise without
				reckoning will be those who neither turn to treatment by
				branding, nor to enchanting, nor take omens, but have
				trust in their Lord." (Muslim).  According to a tradition
				reported on the authority of Hadrat Mughirah bin Shubah,
				the Holy Prophet said: "He who got himself treated by
				branding, or enchanting, became independent of trust in
				Allah." (Tirmidhi).  Hadrat Abdullah bin Mas'ud has
				reported that the Holy Prophet disapproved of ten things
				one of which was recitation of charms and amulets except
				by means of the Mu'awwidhatayn or Mu'awwidhat.	(Abu
				Daud, Ahmad, Nasai, Ibn Hibban, Hakim).  Some hadith also
				show that in the beginning the Holy Prophet had
				altogether forbidden recitation of charms and amulets,
				but later he allowed it on the condition that is should
				not smack of polytheism, but one should recite and blow
				by means of the holy names of Allah, or the words of the
				Quran.	The words used should be understandable and one
				should know that there is nothing sinful in it, and one
				should not wholly rely on the recitation of charms but on
				Allah's will to make it beneficial."  After the
				explanation of the religious aspect, let us now see what
				the Hadith says in this regard.
			</p>
			<p>
				Tabarani in As-Saghir has related a tradition on the
				authority of Hadrat Ali, saying: "Once the Holy Prophet
				was stung by a scorpion during the Prayer.  When the
				Prayer was over, he remarked: God's curse be on the
				scorpion: it neither spares a praying one, nor any other.
				 Then he called for water and salt, and started rubbing
				the place where the scorpion had stung with salt water
				and reciting Qul ya ayyuhal-kafirun, Qul Huwa Allahu
				ahad, Qul a'udhu bi-Rabbil-falaq and Qul a'udhu
				bi-Rabbin-nas, along with it."
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Abbas also has related a tradition to the effect:
				"The Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) used to recite
				this invocation over Hadrat Hasan and Husain: U'idhu kuma
				bi-kalimat Allahit-tamati min kulli shaitan-in wa
				hammati-wa min kulli ayt-in-lam nati: "I give you in the
				refuge of Allah's blameless words, from every devil and
				troublesome thing, and from every evil look." (Bukhari,
				Musnad Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah).
			</p>
			<p>
				A tradition has been related in Muslim, Muwatta, Tabarani
				and Hakim about Uthman bin al-As ath-Thaqafi, with a
				little variation in wording, to the effect that he
				complained to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace),
				saying: "Since I have become a Muslim, I feel a pain in
				my body, which is killing me."	The Holy Prophet said:
				"Place your right hand on the place where you feel the
				pain, then recite Bismillah thrice, and A'udhu billahi wa
				qudratihi min sharri ma ajidu wa uhadhiru ("I seek refuge
				with Allah and with His power from the evil that I find
				and that I fear") seven times, and rub your hand."  In
				Muwatta there is the addition: "Uthman bin Abi al-As
				said: After that my pain disappeared and now I teach the
				same formula to the people of my house."
			</p>
			<p>
				Musnad Ahmad and Tahavi contain this tradition from Talq
				bin Ali: "I was stung by a scorpion in the presence of
				the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace).	The Holy Prophet
				recited something and blew over me and rubbed his hand on
				the affected place."
			</p>
			<p>
				Muslim contains a tradition from Abu Said Khudri, which
				says: "Once when the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
				fell ill, Gabriel came and asked: O Muhammad, are you
				ill?  The Holy Prophet answered in the affirmative. 
				Gabriel said: I blow on you in the name of Allah from
				everything which troubles you and from the evil of every
				soul and the evil look of every envier.  May Allah
				restore you to health.	I blow on you in His name."  A
				similar tradition has been related in Musnad Ahmad on the
				authority of Hadrat Ubadah bin as-Samit, which says: "The
				Holy Prophet was unwell.  I went to visit him and found
				him in great trouble.  When I re-visited him in the
				evening I found him quite well.  When I asked how he had
				become well so soon, he said: Gabriel came and blew over
				me with some words.  Then he recited words similar to
				those reported in the above Hadith.  A tradition similar
				to this has been related on the authority of Hadrat
				Aishah also in Muslim and Musnad Ahmad.
			</p>
			<p>
				Imam Ahmad in his Musnad has related this tradition from
				Hafsah, mother of the Faithful: "One day the Holy Prophet
				(upon whom be peace) visited me in the house and a woman,
				named Shifa, was sitting with me.  She used to blow on
				the people to cure them of blisters.  The Holy Prophet
				said to her: Teach Hafsah also the formula."  Imam Ahmad,
				Abu Daud and Nasai have related this tradition from Shifa
				bint Abdullah herself, saying: "The Holy Prophet said to
				me: Just as you have taught Hafsah reading and writing,
				so teach her blowing to cure blisters as well."
			</p>
			<p>
				In Muslim there is a tradition from Auf bin Malik
				al-Ashjal to the effect: "We used to practice blowing to
				cure diseases.	We asked the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
				peace) for his opinion in this regard.	He said: Let me
				know the words with which you blow over the people. 
				There is no harm in blowing unless it smacks of
				polytheism."
			</p>
			<p>
				Muslim, Musnad Ahmad and Ibn Majah contain a tradition
				from Hadrat Jabir bin Abdullah, saying: "The Holy Prophet
				(upon whom be peace) had forbidden us blowing to cure
				disease.  Then the people of the clan of Hadrat Amr bin
				Hazm came and they said: We had a formula with which we
				used to blow on the people to cure them of scorpion's
				sting (or snake-bite).	But you have forbidden us the
				practice.  Then they recited before him the words which
				they made use of.  Thereupon the Holy Prophet said: I do
				not see any harm in it, so let the one who can do good to
				his brother, do him good."  Another tradition from Jabir
				bin Abdullah in Muslim is: "The family of Hazm had a
				formula to cure snake-bite and the Holy Prophet permitted
				them to practice it."  This is also supported by the
				tradition from Hadrat Aishah, which is contained in
				Muslim, Musnad Ahmad, and Ibn Majah: "The Holy Prophet
				granted permission to a family of the Ansar for blowing
				to cure the evils effects of biting by every poisonous
				creature."  Traditions resembling these have been related
				from Hadrat Anas also in Musnad Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Muslim
				and Ibn Majah, saying that the Holy Prophet gave
				permission for blowing to cure the bite by poisonous
				creatures, the disease of blisters and the effects of the
				evil look."
			</p>
			<p>
				Musnad Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Hakim have related
				this tradition on the authority of Hadrat Umair, freed
				slave of Abi al-Laham: "In the pre-Islamic days I had a
				formula with which I used to blow over the people.  I
				recited it before the Holy Prophet, whereupon he told me
				to drop out such and such words from it, and permitted me
				to blow with the rest of it."
			</p>
			<p>
				According to Muwatta, Hadrat Abu Bakr went to the house
				of his daughter, Hadrat Aishah, and found that she was
				unwell and a Jewish woman was blowing over her. 
				Thereupon he said to her: "Blow over her by means of the
				Book of Allah."  This shows that if the people of the
				Book practice blowing by means of the verses of the Torah
				and the Gospel, it is also permitted.
			</p>
			<p>
				As for the question whether blowing for curing disease is
				efficacious also, or not, its answer is that the Holy
				Prophet (upon whom be peace) not only did not forbid
				anybody to have recourse to cure and medical treatment
				but himself stated that Allah has created a cure for
				every disease and exhorted his followers to use cures. 
				He himself told the people remedies for certain diseases,
				as can be seen in the Hadith in the Kitab at-Tib (Book of
				Cures).  But the cure can be beneficial and useful only
				by Allah's command and permission, otherwise if the cure
				and medical treatment were beneficial in every case, no
				one would have died in hospitals.  Now, if beside the
				cure and medical treatment, Allah's Word and His
				beautiful names also are made use of, or Word and His
				beautiful names also are made use of, or Allah is turned
				to and invoked for help by means of His Word, Names and
				Attributes in a place where no medical aid is available,
				it would not be against reason except for the
				materialists.  However, it is not right to disregard
				intentionally a cure or treatment where it is available,
				and recourse had only to enchanting and reciting of
				charms, and the people should start a regular practice of
				granting amulets as a means of earning their livelihood.
			</p>
			<p>
				Many people in this regard argue from Hadrat Abu Said
				Khudri's tradition which has been related in Bukhari,
				Muslim, Tirmidhi, Musnad Ahmad, Abu Daud and Ibn Majah,
				and it is supported also by a tradition related in
				Bukhari on the authority of Ibn Abbas.	According to it
				the Holy Prophet sent some of his Companions including
				Hadrat Abu Said Khudri on an expedition.  They halted on
				the way at the settlement of an Arabian tribe and
				demanded hospitality from the people, but they refused to
				extend any hospitality.  In the meantime the chief of the
				tribe was stung by a scorpion and the people came to the
				travelers to ask if they had any medicine or formula by
				which their chief could be cured.  Hadrat Abu Said said:
				"Yes, we do have, but since you have refused us
				hospitality, we would not treat him unless you promised
				us to give us something."  They promised to give them a
				flock of goats (according to some traditions, 30 goats),
				and Hadrat Abu Said went and started reciting Surah
				Al-Fatihah and rubbing his saliva on the affected place. 
				Consequently, the chief felt relieved of the effect of
				the poison and the people of the tribe gave them the
				goats as promised.  But the Companions said to one
				another; "Let us not make any use of the goats until we
				have asked the Holy Prophet about it", for they were not
				sure whether it was permissible to accept any reward for
				what they had done.  So they came before the Holy Prophet
				and related what had happened.	The Holy Prophet smiled
				and said: "How did you know that Surah Al-Fatihah could
				also be used for curing such troubles?	Take the goats
				and allocate my share also in it."
			</p>
			<p>
				But before one used this Hadith for permission to adopt a
				regular profession of granting amulets and reciting
				charms, one should keep in view the conditions under
				which Hadrat Abu Said Khudri had recourse to it, and the
				Holy Prophet not only held it as permissible but also
				said that a share for him also should be allocated so
				that there remained no doubt in the minds of the
				Companions that such a thing was permissible.  The
				conditions in Arabia in those days were, as they still
				are, that settlements were situated hundreds of miles
				apart, there were not hotels and restaurants where a
				traveler could buy food when he reached one of these
				after several days' journey.  Under such conditions it
				was considered a moral duty that when a traveler reached
				a settlement the people of the place should extend
				hospitality to him.  Refusal on their part in many cases
				meant death for the travelers, and this was looked upon
				as highly blameworthy among the Arabs.	That is why the
				Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) allowed as permissible
				the act of his Companions.  Since the people of the tribe
				had refused them hospitality, they too refused to treat
				their chief, and became ready to treat him only on the
				condition that they should promise to give them something
				in return.  Then, when one of them with trust in God
				recited Surah Al-Fatihah over the chief and he became
				well, the people gave the promised wages and the Holy
				Prophet allowed that the wages be accepted as lawful and
				pure.  In Bukhari the tradition related on the authority
				of Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas about this incident contains
				the Holy Prophet's words to the effect: "Instead that you
				should have acted otherwise, it was better that you
				recited the Book of Allah and accepted the wages for it."
				 He said this in order to impress the truth that Allah's
				Word is superior to every other kind of enchanting and
				practice of secret arts.  Furthermore, the Message also
				was incidentally conveyed to the Arabian tribe and its
				people made aware of the blessings of the Word that the
				Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) had brought from Allah.
				 This incident cannot be cited as a precedent for the
				people who run clinic in the cities and towns for the
				practice of secret arts and have adopted it as a regular
				profession for earning livelihood.  No precedent of it is
				found in the life and practice of the Holy Prophet (upon
				whom be peace) or his Companions, their followers and the
				earliest Imams.

		<section heading="Relation between Surah Al-Fatihah and the Mu'awwidhatayn">
			<p>
				The last thing which is noteworthy with regard to the
				Mu'awwidhatayn is the relation between the beginning and
				the end of the Quran.  Although the Quran has not been
				arranged chronologically, the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
				peace) arranged in the present order the verses and
				Surahs revealed during 23 years on different occasions to
				meet different needs and situations not by himself but by
				the command of Allah Who reveled them.	According to this
				order, the Quran opens with the Surah Al-Fatihah and ends
				with the Mu'awwidhatayn.  Now, let us have a look at the
				two.  In the beginning, after praising and glorifying
				Allah, Who is Lord of the worlds, Kind, Merciful and
				Master of the Judgment Day, the servant submits: "Lord,
				You alone I worship and to You alone I turn for help, and
				the most urgent help that I need from You is to be guided
				to the Straight Way."  In answer, he is given by Allah
				the whole Quran to show him the Straight Way, which is
				concluded thus: Man prays to Allah, Who is Lord of dawn,
				Lord of men, King of men, Deity of men, saying: "I seek
				refuge only with You for protection from every evil and
				mischief of every creature, and in particular, from the
				evil whisperings of devils, be they from among men or
				jinn, for they are the greatest obstacle in following the
				Straight Way."	The relation that the beginning bears
				with the end, cannot remain hidden from anyone who has
				understanding and insight.

		</section>
	</sura>
	<sura num="114">
		<section heading="Name">
			<p>
				Although these two Surahs of the Quran are separate
				entities and are written in the Mushaf also under
				separate names, yet they are so deeply related mutually
				and their contents so closely resemble each other's that
				they have been designated by a common name Mu'awwidhatayn
				(the two Surahs in which refuge with Allah has been
				sought).  Imam Baihaqi in Dala'il an-Nubuwwat has written
				that these Surahs were revealed together, that is why the
				combined name of both is Mu'awwidhatayn.  We are writing
				the same one Introduction to both, for they discuss and
				deal with just the same matters and topics.  However,
				they will be explained and commented on separately below.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Period of Revelation">
			<p>
				Hadrat Hasan Basri, 'Ikrimah, 'Ata' and Jabir bin Zaid
				say that these Surahs are Makki.  A tradition from Hadrat
				'Abdullah bin 'Abbas also supports the same view. 
				However, according to another tradition from him, it is
				Madani and the same view is held also by Hadrat 'Abdullah
				bin Zubair and Qatadah.  One of the traditions which
				strengthens this second view is the Hadith which Muslim,
				Tirmidhi, Nasa'i and Imam Ahmad bin Handball have related
				on the authority of Hadrat 'Uqbah bin 'Amir.  He says
				that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peach) one day said
				to him:  "Do you know what kind of verses have been
				revealed to me tonight? - these matchless verses are
				A'udhu bi-Rabbil-falaq and A'udhu bi-Rabbin-nas.  This
				Hadith is used as an argument for these Surahs to be
				Madani because Hadrat 'Uqbah bin 'Amir had become a
				Muslim in Madinah after the hijrah, as related by Abu
				Da'ud and Nasa'i on the basis of his own statement. 
				Other traditions which have lent strength to this view
				are those related by Ibn Sa'd, Muhiyy-us-Sunnah Baghawi,
				Imam Nasafi, Imam Baihaqi, Hafiz Ibn Hajar, Hafiz
				Badr-uddin 'Ayni, 'Abd bin Humaid and others to the
				effect that these Surahs were revealed when the Jews had
				worked magic on the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) in
				Madinah and he had fallen ill under its effect.  Ibn Sa'd
				has related on the authority of Waqidi that this happened
				in A.H. 7.  On this very basis Sufyan bin Uyainah also
				has described these Surah as Madani.
			</p>
			<p>
				But as we have explained in the Introduction to Surah
				Al-Ikhlas, when it is said about a certain Surah or verse
				that it was revealed on this or that particular occasion,
				it does not necessarily mean that it was revealed for the
				first time on that very occasion.  Rather it sometimes so
				happened that a Surah or a verse had previously been
				revealed, then on the occurrence or appearance of a
				particular incident or situation, the Holy Prophet's
				attention was drawn to it by Allah for the second time,
				or even again and again.  In our opinion the same also
				was the case with the Mu'awwidhatayn.  The subject matter
				of these Surahs is explicit that these were sent down at
				Makkah in the first instance when opposition to the Holy
				Prophet there had grown very intense.  Later, when at
				Madinah storms of opposition were raised by the
				hypocrites, Jews and polytheists, the Holy Prophet was
				instructed to recite these very Surahs, as has been
				mentioned in the above cited tradition from Hadrat Uqbah
				bin Amir.  After this, when magic was worked on him, and
				his illness grew intense, Gabriel came and instructed him
				by Allah's command to recite these very Surahs. 
				Therefore, in our opinion, the view held by the
				commentators who describe both these Surahs as Makki is
				more reliable.	Regarding them as connected exclusively
				with the incident of magic is difficult, for to this
				incident related only one verse (v.4), the remaining
				verses of Surah al Falaq and the whole of Surah An-Nas
				have nothing to do with it directly.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme and Subject-Matter">
			<p>
				The conditions under which these two Surahs were sent
				down in Makkah were as follows.  As soon as the Holy
				Prophet (upon whom be peace) began to preach the message
				of Islam, it seemed as though he had provoked all classes
				of the people around him.  As his message spread the
				opposition of the disbelieving Quraish also became more
				and more intense.  As long as they had any hope that they
				would be able to prevent him from preaching his message
				by throwing some temptation in his way, or striking some
				bargain with him, their hostility did not become very
				active.  But when the Holy Prophet disappointed them
				completely that he would not effect any kind of
				compromise with them in the matter of faith, and in Surah
				Al-Kafirun they were plainly told: "I do not worship
				those who you worship nor are you worshipers of Him Whom
				I worship.  For you is your religion and for me is mine",
				the hostility touched its extreme limits.  More
				particularly, the families whose members (men or women,
				boys or girls) had accepted Islam, were burning with rage
				from within against the Holy Prophet.  They were cursing
				him, holding secret consultations to kill him quietly in
				the dark of the night so that the Bani Hashim could not
				discover the murderer and take revenge; magic and charms
				were being worked on him so as to cause his death, or
				make him fall ill, or become mad; satans from among the
				men and the jinn spread on every side so as to whisper
				one or another evil into the hearts of the people against
				him and the Quran brought by him so that they became
				suspicious of him and fled him.  There were many people
				who were burning with jealousy against him, for they
				could not tolerate that a man from another family or clan
				than their own should flourish and become prominent.  For
				instance, the reason why Abu Jahl was crossing every
				limit in his hostility to him has been explained by
				himself: "We and the Bani Abdi Manaf (to which the Holy
				Prophet belonged) were rivals of each other: they fed
				others, we too fed others; they provided conveyances to
				the people, we too did the same; they gave donations, we
				too gave donations, so much so that when they and we have
				become equal in honor and nobility, they now proclaim
				that they have a Prophet who is inspired from the heaven;
				how can we compete with them in this field?  By God, we
				will never acknowledge him, nor affirm faith in him".
				(Ibn Hisham, vol. I, pp. 337-338).
			</p>
			<p>
				Such were the conditions when the Holy Prophet (upon whom
				be peace) was commanded to tell the people: "I seek
				refuge with the Lord of the dawn, from the evil of
				everything that He has created, and from the evil of the
				darkness of night and from the evil of magicians, men and
				women, and from the evil of the envious", and to tell
				them: "I seek refuge with the Lord of mankind, the King
				of mankind, and the Deity of mankind, from the evil of
				the whisperer, who returns over and over again, who
				whispers (evil) into the hearts of men, whether he be
				from among the jinn or men."  This is similar to what the
				Prophet Moses had been told to say when Pharaoh had
				expressed his design before his full court to kill him:
				"I have taken refuge with my Lord and your Lord against
				every arrogant person who does not believe in the Day of
				Reckoning." (Al-Mu'min: 27).  And: "I have taken refuge
				with my Lord and your Lord lest you should assail me."
				(Ad-Dukhan;20).
			</p>
			<p>
				On both occasions these illustrious Prophets of Allah
				were confronted with well-equipped, resourceful and
				powerful enemies.  On both occasions they stood firm on
				their message of Truth against their strong opponents,
				whereas they had no material power on the strength of
				which they could fight them, and on both occasions they
				utterly disregarded the threats and dangerous plans and
				hostile devices of the enemy, saying: "We have taken
				refuge with the Lord of the universe against you."
				Obviously, such firmness and steadfastness can be shown
				only by the person who has the conviction that the power
				of His Lord is the supreme power, that all powers of the
				world are insignificant against Him, and that no one can
				harm the one who has taken His refuge.	Only such a one
				can say: "I will not give up preaching the Word of Truth.
				 I care the least for what you may say or do, for I have
				taken refuge with my Lord and your Lord and Lord of all
				universe."
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Question whether Mu'awwidhatayn are, or are not, Quranic">
			<p>
				The above discussion is enough to help one understand
				fully the theme and content of the two Surahs, but since
				three points in the books of Hadith and commentary
				concerning these Surahs have been discussed, which are
				likely to create doubts in the minds, it is necessary to
				clear them also here.
			</p>
			<p>
				First, whether it is absolutely established that these
				two Surahs are the Quranic Surahs, or whether there is
				some doubt in this regard.  This question arose because
				in the traditions related from an illustrious Companion
				like Hadrat Abdullah bin Mas'ud, it has been said that he
				did not regard these two Surahs as the Surahs of the
				Quran and had eliminated these from his copy of the
				Mushaf.  Imam Ahmad, Bazzar, Tabarani, Ibn Marduyah, Abu
				Ya'la, Abdullah bin Ahmad bin Hanbal, Humaydi, Abu
				Nu'aim, Ibn Hibban and other traditionists have related
				this from Hadrat Abdullah bin Mas'ud with different
				chains of transmitters and mostly on sound authority. 
				According to these traditions, he not only eliminated
				these Surahs from the Mushaf but it has also been
				reported that he used to say: "Do not mix up with the
				Quran that which is not of the Quran.  These two Surahs
				are not included in the Quran.	This was only a command
				enjoined on the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) for
				seeking God's refuge." In some traditions there is also
				the addition that he did not recite these Surahs in the
				Prayer.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the basis of these traditions the opponents of Islam
				had an opportunity to raise doubts about the Quran,
				saying that this Book, God forbid, is not free from
				corruption.  For when, according to a Companion of the
				rank of Hadrat Abdullah bin Mas'ud, these two Surahs are
				an annexation to the Quran, many other additions and
				subtractions also might have been made in it.  To rid the
				Quran of this blame Qadi Abu Bakr Al-Baqillani, Qadi Iyad
				and others took the stand that Ibn Mas'ud was not in fact
				a denier of the Mu'awwidhatayn being Qur'anic but only
				refused to write them in the Mushaf.  For, according to
				him, only that which the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
				peace) had allowed, should be written in the Mushaf, and
				Ibn Mas'ud did not receive the information that the Holy
				Prophet had allowed this.  But this stand is not correct,
				for according to sound evidence, it is confirmed that Ibn
				Mas'ud (may Allah be pleased with him) had denied that
				these were Surahs of the Quran.  Some other scholars, for
				instance, Imam Nawawi, Imam Ibn Hazm and Imam
				Fakhr-udding Razi, regard this as a pure lie and
				falsehood that Ibn Mas'ud had asserted any such thing. 
				But to reject genuine historical facts without sound
				evidence is unscientific.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, the question is:  How can the blame that attaches to
				the Quran because of these traditions of Ibn Mas'ud
				correctly refuted?  This question has several answers
				which we shall give below in sequence:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Hafiz Bazzar after relating these traditions of
					Ibn Mas'ud in his Musnad, has written that he is
					solitary and isolated in his this opinion; no one
					from among the Companions has supported this
					view.
				</li>
				<li>
					The copies of the Quran which the third Caliph,
					Hadrat Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him),
					had got compiled by the consensus of the
					Companions and which he had sent from the Islamic
					Caliphate officially to the centers of the world
					of Islam contained both these Surahs.
				</li>
				<li>
					The Mushaf which, since the sacred time of the
					Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) till today, has
					the seal of consensus of the entire world of
					Islam, contains both these Surahs.  The solitary
					opinion of only Abdullah bin Mas'ud, in spite of
					his high rank, has no weight against this great
					consensus.
				</li>
				<li>
					It is confirmed by sound and reliable hadith from
					the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) that he not
					only recited these Surahs in the Prayer himself
					but instructed others also to recite them, and
					taught them to the people as the Surahs of the
					Quran.	Consider, for instance, the following
					hadith:
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				We have cited on the authority of Muslim, Ahmad, Tirmidhi
				and Nasai the tradition of Hadrat Uqbah bin Amir that the
				Holy Prophet told him about Surah Al-Falaq and Surah
				An-Nas, saying that those verses had been revealed to him
				that night.  A tradition in Nasai from Uqbah bin Amir is
				to the effect that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
				recited both these Surahs in the Morning Prayer.  Imam
				Ahmad on sound authority has related in his Musnad the
				tradition from a Companion that the Holy Prophet said to
				him, "When you perform the Prayer, recite both these
				Surahs in it."	In Musnad Ahmad, Abu Daud and Nasai this
				tradition of Uqbah bin Amir has been related: "The Holy
				Prophet said to him: Should I not teach you two such
				Surahs as are among the best Surahs that the people
				recite?  He said: Do teach me, O Messenger of Allah. 
				Thereupon the Holy Prophet taught him the Mu'awwidhatayn.
				 Then the Prayer began and the Holy Prophet recited the
				same two Surahs in it also, and when after the Prayer the
				Holy Prophet passed by him, he said to him, 'O Uqbah, how
				did you like it?'  Then he instructed him to the effect:
				When you go to bed, and when you get up from bed, recite
				these Surahs."	In Musnad Ahmad, Abu Da'ud, Tirmidhi and
				Nasa'i there is a tradition from Uqbah bin Amir, saying
				that the Holy Prophet exhorted him to recite the
				Mu'awwidhat (i.e. Qul Huwa Allahu ahad and the
				Mu'awwidhatayn) after every Prayer.  Nasai, Ibn Marduyah
				and Hakim have related this tradition also from Uqbah bin
				Amir: "Once the Holy Prophet was riding on a conveyance
				and I was walking along with him with my hand placed on
				his sacred foot.  I said: Kindly teach me Surah Hud or
				Surah Yusuf.  He replied: In the sight of Allah there is
				nothing more beneficial for the servant than Qul a'udhu
				bi-Rabbil-falaq."  A tradition from Abdullah bin Abid
				al-Juhani has been related by Nasai, Baihaqi and Ibn Sad,
				saying that the Holy Prophet said to him: "Ibn Abid,
				should I not tell you what are the best things out of the
				means by which the seekers of refuge have sought refuge
				with Allah?  I submitted: Do teach me, O Messenger of
				Allah.	He replied: Qul a'udhu bi-Rabbil-falaq and Qul
				a-udhu bi Rabbin-nas - both these Surahs."  Ibn Marduyah
				had related from Hadrat Umm Salamah: "The Surahs best
				liked by Allah are: Qul a'udhu bi-Rabbil-falaq and Qul
				a'udhu bi-Rabbin-nas."
			</p>
			<p>
				Here, the question arises: what caused Hadrat Abdullah
				bin Mas'ud the misunderstanding that these two are not
				Surahs of the Quran?  We get the answer to it when we
				combine two traditions: first, that Hadrat Abdullah bin
				Mas'ud asserted that this was only a command which the
				Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) was given to teach him
				the method of seeking refuge with Allah; second, the
				tradition which Imam Bukhari has related in his Sahih,
				Imam Ahmad in his Musnad, Hafiz Abu Bakr al-Humaidi in
				his Musnad, Abu Nu'aim in his Al-Mustakhraj and Nasai in
				his Sunan, with different chains of transmitters, on the
				authority of Zirr bin Hubaish, with a slight variation in
				wording from Hadrat Ubayy bin Kab, who held a
				distinguished place among the Companions on the basis of
				his knowledge of the Quran.  Zirr bin Hubaish states: "I
				said to Hadrat Ubayy: Your brother, Abdullah bin Mas'ud,
				says these things.  What do you say about this view?  He
				replied: I had questioned the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
				peace) about this.  He said to me: I was told to say
				'qul', so I said 'qul'.  Therefore, we too say the same
				as the Holy Prophet said."  In the tradition related by
				Imam Ahmad, Hadrat Ubayy's words are to the effect: "I
				bear witness that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
				told me that Gabriel (peace be on him) had told him to
				say: Qul a'udhu bi-Rabbil-falaq; therefore, he recited
				likewise, and Gabriel asked him to say: Qul a'udhu
				bi-Rabbin-nas; therefore he too said likewise.	Hence, we
				too say as the Holy Prophet said."  A little
				consideration of these two traditions will show that the
				word qul (say) in the two Surahs caused Hadrat Abdullah
				bin Mas'ud the misunderstanding that the Holy Prophet
				(upon whom be peace) had been commanded to say: A'udhu
				bi-Rabbil-falaq and A'udhu bi-Rabbin-nas.  But he did not
				feel any need to question the Holy Prophet about it.  In
				the mind of Hadrat Ubbay bin Kab also a question arose
				about his and he put it before the Holy Prophet.  The
				Holy Prophet replied: "Since Gabriel (peace be on him)
				had said qul, so I too say qul."  Let us put it like
				this.  If somebody is commanded and asked: "Say, I seek
				refuge", he will not carry out the command, saying: "Say,
				I seek refuge", but he will drop the word "say" and say:
				"I seek refuge."  On the contrary, if the messenger of a
				superior officer conveys to somebody the message in these
				words: "Say, I seek refuge", and this command is given to
				him not only for his own person but to be conveyed to
				others, he will convey the words of the message verbatim
				to the people, and will not have the permission to drop
				anything from the text of the message.	Thus, the fact
				that these two Surahs begin with the word qul is a clear
				proof that it is Divine Word, which the Holy Prophet
				(upon whom be peace) was bound to convey verbatim.  It
				was not merely a command given to him for his person. 
				Besides these two Surahs, there are 330 other verses in
				the Quran which begin with the word qul (say).	The
				presence of qul in all these is a proof that it is Divine
				Word. which was obligatory for the Holy Prophet to convey
				verbatim; otherwise if qul everywhere had meant a
				command, the Holy Prophet would have dropped it and said
				only that which he was commanded to say, and it would not
				have been recorded in the Quran, but, on the contrary, he
				would have remained content with saying only what he was
				commanded to say.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here, if one considers this, one can understand fully
				well how unreasonable it is to regard the Companions as
				infallible and to make the clamor that a Companion has
				been defamed as soon as one hears a saying or doing of
				his being described as wrong.  Here, one can clearly see
				what a blunder happened to be committed by an illustrious
				Companion like Hadrat Abdullah bin Mas'ud about two
				Surahs of the Quran.  If such an error could be committed
				by an eminent Companion like him, others also might
				commit an error.  We can examine it in the scientific
				way, and describe it as wrong if a thing said or done by
				a Companion is proved to be wrong.  But wicked indeed
				would be the person who went beyond describing a wrong
				act as wrong and started reproving and finding fault with
				the Companions of the Holy Prophet of Allah.  Concerning
				the Mu'awwidhatayn the commentators and traditionists
				have described the opinion of Ibn Mas'ud as wrong, but no
				one has dared to say that by denying these two Surahs of
				the Quran, he had, God forbid, become a disbeliever.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Question of Holy Prophet's being affected by Magic">
			<p>
				The second thing that has arisen in respect of these two
				Surahs is that, according to traditions, magic had been
				worked on the Holy Prophet, and he had fallen ill under
				its effect, and Gabriel (peace be on him) had instructed
				him to repeat these Surahs to remove the charm.  This has
				been objected to by many rationalists of both ancient and
				modern times.  They say that if these traditions are
				accepted, the whole Shari'ah becomes doubtful.	For if
				the Prophet could be charmed, and according to these
				traditions he was charmed, one cannot say what the
				Prophet might have been made to say and do under the
				influence of magic by his opponents, and what in his
				teaching may be Divine and what the result of magic.  Not
				only this: they also allege that if this is accepted as
				true, it might well be that the Prophet might have been
				prompted to make the claim to Prophethood through magic
				and the Prophet by misunderstanding might have thought
				that an angel had come to him.	They also argue that
				these traditions clash with the Quran.	The Quran
				mentions the accusation of the disbelievers who said that
				the Prophet was bewitched (Bani Isra'il:47), but these
				traditions confirm the accusation of the disbelievers
				that the Prophet had actually been charmed and bewitched.
			</p>
			<p>
				For a proper investigation of this question it is
				necessary that one should first see whether it is
				established by authentic historical evidence that the
				Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) had actually been
				affected by magic, and if so, what it was and to what
				extent.  Then it should be seen whether the objections
				raised against what is established historically do
				actually apply to it or not.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Muslim scholars of the earliest period were truly
				honest and upright in that they did not try to corrupt
				history or conceal facts according to their own ideas,
				concepts and assumptions.  They conveyed intact to the
				later generations whatever was confirmed historically,
				and did not at all care how the material supplied by them
				could be used by the one who was bent upon drawing
				perverse conclusions from the facts.  Now, if something
				stands confirmed by authentic and historical means, it is
				neither right for an honest and rightminded person that
				he should deny history on the ground that in case he
				accepted it, it would lead to these evil results
				according to his thinking, nor it is right that he should
				add to and stretch beyond its genuine limits by
				conjecture and speculation whatever is established
				historically.  Instead, he should accept history as
				history and then see what is actually proved by it and
				what is not.
			</p>
			<p>
				As far as the historical aspect is concerned, the
				incident of the Holy Prophet's being affected by magic is
				absolutely confirmed, and if it can be refuted by
				scientific criticism, then no historical event of the
				world can be proved right and genuine.	It has been
				related by Bukhari, Muslim, Nasai, Ibn Majah, Imam Ahmad,
				Abdur Razzaq, Humaidi, Baihaqi, Tabarani, Ibn Sad, Ibn
				Mardayah, Ibn Abi Shaibah, Hakim, Abd bin Humaid and
				other traditionists on the authority of Hadrat Aishah,
				Hadrat Zaid bin Arqam and Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas,
				through so many different and numerous channels that
				forgery is out of the question.  Although each tradition
				by itself is an isolated report (khabar wahid), we give
				it below as a connected event from the details provided
				by the traditions.
			</p>
			<p>
				After the peace treaty of Hudaibiyah when the Holy
				Prophet (upon whom be peace) returned to Madinah, a
				deputation of the Jews of Khaibar visited Madinah in
				Muharram, A.H. 7 and met a famous magician, Labid bin
				Asam, who belonged to the Ansar tribe of Bani Zurayq. 
				They said to him: "You know how Muhammad (upon whom be
				Allah's peace and blessings) has treated us.  We have
				tried our best to bewitch him but have not succeeded. 
				Now we have come to you because you are a more skilled
				magician.  Here are three gold coins, accept these and
				cast a powerful magic spell on Muhammad."  In those days
				the Holy Prophet had a Jewish boy as his attendant. 
				Through him they obtained a piece of the Holy Prophet's
				comb with some hair stuck to it.  Magic was worked on the
				same hair and the teeth of the comb.  According to some
				traditions, magic was worked by Labid bin Asam himself,
				according to others, his sisters were more skilled than
				him and he got the spell cast through them.  Whatever be
				the case, Labid placed this spell in the spathe of a male
				date-tree and his it under a stone at the bottom of
				Dharwan or Dhi Arwan, the well of Bani Zurayq.	The spell
				took one whole year to have effect upon the Holy Prophet
				(upon whom be peace).  In the latter half of the year the
				Holy Prophet started feeling as if was unwell.	The last
				forty days became hard on him, of which the last three
				days were even harder.	But its maximum effect on him was
				that he way melting away from within.  He thought he had
				done a thing whereas, in fact, he had not done it: he
				thought he had visited his wives whereas he had not
				visited them; and sometimes he would doubt having seen
				something whereas, in fact, he had not seen it.  All
				these effects were confined to his own person; so much so
				that the other people could not notice what state he was
				passing through.  As for his being a Prophet, no change
				occurred in the performance of his duties.  There is no
				tradition to say that he might have forgotten some verses
				of the Quran in those days, or might have recited a verse
				wrongly, or a change might have occurred in the
				assemblies and in his counsels and sermons, or he might
				have presented a discourse as Revelation which may not
				have been revealed to him, or he might have missed a
				Prayer and thought that he had performed it.  God forbid,
				if any such thing had happened, it would have caused a
				clamor and the whole of Arabia would have known that a
				magician had overpowered the one whom no power had been
				able to overpower.  But the Holy Prophet's position as a
				Prophet remained wholly unaffected by it.  Only in his
				personal life he remained worried on account of it.  At
				last, one day when he was in the house of Hadrat Aishah,
				he prayed to Allah to be restored to full health.  In the
				meantime he fell asleep or drowsed and on waking he said
				to Hadrat Aishah: "My Lord has told me what I had asked
				of Him."  Hadrat Aishah asked what it was.  He replied:
				"Two men (i.e. two angels in human guise) came to me. 
				One sat near my head and the other near my feet.  The
				first asked: what has happened to him?	The other
				replied: Magic has been worked on him.	The first asked:
				who has worked it?  He replied: Labid bin Asam.  He
				asked: In what is it contained?  He replied: In the comb
				and hair covered in the spathe of a male date-tree.  He
				asked: where is it?  He replied: under a stone at the
				bottom of Dhi Arwan (or Dharwan), the well of Bani
				Zurayq.  He asked: what should be done about it?  He
				replied: the well should be emptied and it should be
				taken out from under the stone.  The Holy Prophet then
				sent Hadrat Ali, Hadrat Ammar bin Yasir and Hadrat
				Zubair: They were also joined by Jubair bin Iyas az-Zurqi
				(two men from Bani Zurayq).  Later the Holy Prophet also
				arrived at the well along with some Companions.  The
				water was taken out and the spathe recovered.  There they
				found that beside the comb and hair there was a cord with
				eleven knots on it and a wax image with needles pricked
				into it.  Gabriel (peace be on him) came and told him to
				repeat the Mu'awwidhatayn.  As he repeated verse after 
			</p>
			<p>
				verse, a know was loosened and a needle taken out every
				time, till on finishing the last words all the knots were
				loosened and all the needles removed, and he was entirely
				freed from the charm.  After this he called Laid and
				questioned him.  He confessed his guilt and the Holy
				Prophet let him go, for he never avenged himself on
				anyone for any harm done to his person.  He even declined
				to talk about it to others, saying that Allah had
				restored him to health; therefore he did not like that he
				should incite the people against anyone.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is the story of the magic worked on the Holy
				Prophet.  There if nothing in it which might run counter
				to his office of Prophethood.  In his personal capacity
				if any injury could be inflicted on him as it happened in
				the Battle of Uhud, if he could fall from his horse and
				be hurt as is confirmed by the Hadith, if he could be
				stung by a scorpion as has been mentioned in some
				Traditions and none of these negates the protection
				promised him by Allah in his capacity as a Prophet, he
				could also fall ill under the influence of magic in his
				personal capacity.  That a Prophet can be affected by
				magic is also confirmed by the Quran.  In Surah Al-A'raf
				it has been said about the magicians of Pharaoh that when
				they confronted the Prophet Moses, they bewitched the
				eyes of thousands of people who had assembled to witness
				the encounter (v. 116).  In Surah Ta Ha it has been said
				that not only the common people but the Prophet Moses too
				felt that the cords and staffs that they cast were
				running towards them like so many snakes, and this filled
				Moses' heart with fear.  Thereupon Allah revealed to him:
				"Don't fear for you will come out victorious.  Cast down
				you staff." (vv. 66-69).  As for the objection that this
				then confirms the accusation of the disbelievers of
				Makkah that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) was a
				bewitched man, its answer is that the disbelievers did
				not call him a bewitched man in the sense that he had
				fallen ill under that effect of magic cast by somebody,
				but in the sense that some magician has, God forbid, made
				him mad, and he had made claim to Prophethood and was
				telling the people tales of Hell and Heaven in his same
				madness.  Now, obviously this objection does not at all
				apply to a matter about which history confirms that the
				magic spell had affected only the person of Muhammad
				(upon whom be peace) and not the Prophethood of Muhammad
				(upon whom be peace), which remained wholly unaffected by
				it.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this connection, another thing worthy of mention is
				that the people who regard magic as a kind of
				superstition hold this view only because the effect of
				magic cannot be explained scientifically.  But there are
				many things in the world which one experiences and
				observes but one cannot explain scientifically how they
				happen.  If we cannot give any such explanation it does
				not become necessary that we should deny the thing itself
				which we cannot explain.  Magic, in fact, is a
				psychological phenomenon which can affect the body
				through the mind just as physical things affect the mind
				through the body.  Fear, for instance, is a psychological
				phenomenon, but it affects the body: the hair stand on
				end and the body shudders.  Magic does not; in fact,
				change the reality, but under its influence man's mind
				and senses start feeling as if reality had changed.  The
				staffs and the cords that the magicians had thrown
				towards the Prophet Moses, had not actually become
				snakes, but the eyes of the multitude of people were so
				bewitched that everybody felt they were snakes; even the
				senses of the Prophet Moses could not remain unaffected
				by the magic spell.  Likewise, in Al-Baqarah: 102, it has
				been said that in Babylon people learnt such magic from
				Harut and Marut as could cause division between husband
				and wife.  This too was a psychological phenomenon. 
				Obviously, if the people did not find it efficacious by
				experience they could not become its customers.  No
				doubt, it is correct that just like the bullet of the
				rifle and the bomb from the aircraft, magic too cannot
				have effect without Allah's permission, but it would be
				mere stubbornness to deny a thing which has been
				experienced and observed by man for thousands for years.
			</p>

		<section heading="Question of Reciting Charms and Amulets in Islam">
			<p>
				The third thing that arises in connection with these
				Surahs is whether recitation of charms and amulets has
				any place in Islam, and whether such recitation is by
				itself efficacious or not.  This question arises for in
				many hadith it has been reported that the Holy Prophet
				(upon whom be peace) at the time of going to bed every
				night, especially during illness, used to recite the
				Mu'awwidhatayn (or according to other reports, the
				Mu'awwidhat, i.e. Qul Huwa-Allahu Ahad and the
				Mu'awwidhatayn) thrice, blow in his hands and then rub
				the hands on his body from head to foot as far as his
				hands could reach.  During his last illness when it was
				not longer possible for him to so do, Hadrat Aishah
				recited these Surahs herself or by his command blew on
				his hands hin view of their being blessed and rubbed them
				on his body.  Traditions on this subject have been
				related in Bukhari, Muslim, Nasai, Ibn Majah, Abu Da'ud
				and Mu'atta of Imam Malik through authentic channels on
				the authority of Hadrat Aishah herself beside whom no one
				could be better acquainted with the domestic life of the
				Holy Prophet.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this regard, one should first understand its religious
				aspect.  In the Hadith a lengthy tradition has been
				related on the authority of Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas, at
				the end of which the Holy Prophet is reported to have
				said: "The people of my Ummah to enter Paradise without
				reckoning will be those who neither turn to treatment by
				branding, nor to enchanting, nor take omens, but have
				trust in their Lord." (Muslim).  According to a tradition
				reported on the authority of Hadrat Mughirah bin Shubah,
				the Holy Prophet said: "He who got himself treated by
				branding, or enchanting, became independent of trust in
				Allah." (Tirmidhi).  Hadrat Abdullah bin Mas'ud has
				reported that the Holy Prophet disapproved of ten things
				one of which was recitation of charms and amulets except
				by means of the Mu'awwidhatayn or Mu'awwidhat.	(Abu
				Daud, Ahmad, Nasai, Ibn Hibban, Hakim).  Some hadith also
				show that in the beginning the Holy Prophet had
				altogether forbidden recitation of charms and amulets,
				but later he allowed it on the condition that it should
				not smack of polytheism, but one should recite and blow
				by means of the holy names of Allah, or the words of the
				Quran.	The words used should be understandable and one
				should know that there is nothing sinful in it, and one
				should not wholly rely on the recitation of charms but on
				Allah's will to make it beneficial."  After the
				explanation of the religious aspect, let us now see what
				the Hadith says in this regard.
			</p>
			<p>
				Tabarani in As-Saghir has related a tradition on the
				authority of Hadrat Ali, saying: "One the Holy Prophet
				was stung by a scorpion during the Prayer.  When the
				Prayer was over, he remarked: God's curse be on the
				scorpion: it neither spares a praying one, nor any other.
				 Then he called for water and salt, and started rubbing
				the place where the scorpion had stung with salt water
				and reciting Qul ya ayyuhal-kafirun, Qul Huwa Allahu
				ahad, Qul a'udhu bi-Rabbil-falaq and Qul a'udhu
				bi-Rabbin-nas, along with it."
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Abbas also has related a tradition to the effect:
				"The Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) used to recite
				this invocation over Hadrat Hasan and Husain: U'idhu kuma
				bi-kalimat Allahit-tamati min kulli shaitan-in wa
				hammati-wa min kulli ayt-in-lam nati: "I give you in the
				refuge of Allah's blameless words, from every devil and
				troublesome thing, and from every evil look." (Bukhari,
				Musnad Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah).
			</p>
			<p>
				A tradition has been related in Muslim, Muwatta, Tabarani
				and Hakim about Uthman bin al-As ath-Thaqafi, with a
				little variation in wording, to the effect that he
				complained to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace),
				saying: "Since I have become a Muslim, I feel a pain in
				my body, which is killing me."	The Holy Prophet said:
				"Place your right hand on the place where you feel the
				pain, then recite Bismillah thrice, and A'udhu billahi wa
				qudratihi min sharri ma ajidu wa uhadhiru ("I seek refuge
				with Allah and with His power from the evil that I find
				and that I fear") seven times, and rub your hand."  In
				Muwatta there is the addition: "Uthman bin Abi al-As
				said: After that my pain disappeared and now I teach the
				same formula to the people of my house."
			</p>
			<p>
				Musnad Ahmad and Tahavi contain this tradition from Talq
				bin Ali: "I was stung by a scorpion in the presence of
				the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace).	The Holy Prophet
				recited something and blew over me and rubbed his hand on
				the affected place."
			</p>
			<p>
				Muslim contains a tradition from Abu Said Khudri, which
				says: "Once when the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
				fell ill, Gabriel came and asked: O Muhammad, are you
				ill?  The Holy Prophet answered in the affirmative. 
				Gabriel said: I blow on you in the name of Allah from
				everything which troubles you and from the evil of every
				soul and the evil look of every envier.  May Allah
				restore you to health.	I blow on you in His name."  A
				similar tradition has been related in Musnad Ahmad on the
				authority of Hadrat Ubadah bin as-Samit, which says: "The
				Holy Prophet was unwell.  I went to visit him and found
				him in great trouble.  When I re-visited him in the
				evening I found him quite well.  When I asked how he had
				become well so soon, he said: Gabriel came and blew over
				me with some words.  Then he recited words similar to
				those reported in the above Hadith.  A tradition similar
				to this has been related on the authority of Hadrat
				Aishah also in Muslim and Musnad Ahmad.
			</p>
			<p>
				Imam Ahmad in his Musnad has related this tradition from
				Hafsah, mother of the Faithful: "One day the Holy Prophet
				(upon whom be peace) visited me in the house and a woman,
				named Shifa, was sitting with me.  She used to blow on
				the people to cure them of blisters.  The Holy Prophet
				said to her: Teach Hafsah also the formula."  Imam Ahmad,
				Abu Daud and Nasai have related this tradition from Shifa
				bint Abdullah herself, saying: "The Holy Prophet said to
				me: Just as you have taught Hafsah reading and writing,
				so teach her blowing to cure blisters as well."
			</p>
			<p>
				In Muslim there is a tradition from Auf bin Malik
				al-Ashjal to the effect: "We used to practice blowing to
				cure diseases.	We asked the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
				peace) for his opinion in this regard.	He said: Let me
				know the words with which you blow over the people. 
				There is no harm in blowing unless it smacks of
				polytheism."
			</p>
			<p>
				Muslim, Musnad Ahmad and Ibn Majah contain a tradition
				from Hadrat Jabir bin Abdullah, saying: "The Holy Prophet
				(upon whom be peace) had forbidden us blowing to cure
				disease.  Then the people of the clan of Hadrat Amr bin
				Hazm came and they said: We had a formula with which we
				used to blow on the people to cure them of scorpion's
				sting (or snake-bite).	But you have forbidden us the
				practice.  Then they recited before him the words which
				they made use of.  Thereupon the Holy Prophet said: I do
				not see any harm in it, so let the one who can do good to
				his brother, do him good."  Another tradition from Jabir
				bin Abdullah in Muslim is: "The family of Hazm had a
				formula to cure snake-bite and the Holy Prophet permitted
				them to practice it."  This is also supported by the
				tradition from Hadrat Aishah, which is contained in
				Muslim, Musnad Ahmad, and Ibn Majah: "The Holy Prophet
				granted permission to a family of the Ansar for blowing
				to cure the evils effects of biting by every poisonous
				creature."  Traditions resembling these have been related
				from Hadrat Anas also in Musnad Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Muslim
				and Ibn Majah, saying that the Holy Prophet gave
				permission for blowing to cure the bite by poisonous
				creatures, the disease of blisters and the effects of the
				evil look."
			</p>
			<p>
				Musnad Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Hakim have related
				this tradition on the authority of Hadrat Umair, freed
				slave of Abi al-Laham: "In the pre-Islamic days I had a
				formula with which I used to blow over the people.  I
				recited it before the Holy Prophet, whereupon he told me
				to drop out such and such words from it, and permitted me
				to blow with the rest of it."
			</p>
			<p>
				According to Muwatta, Hadrat Abu Bakr went to the house
				of his daughter, Hadrat Aishah, and found that she was
				unwell and a Jewish woman was blowing over her. 
				Thereupon he said to her: "Blow over her by means of the
				Book of Allah."  This shows that if the people of the
				Book practice blowing by means of the verses of the Torah
				and the Gospel, it is also permitted.
			</p>
			<p>
				As for the question whether blowing for curing disease is
				efficacious also, or not, its answer is that the Holy
				Prophet (upon whom be peace) not only did not forbid
				anybody to have recourse to cure and medical treatment
				but himself stated that Allah has created a cure for
				every disease and exhorted his followers to use cures. 
				He himself told the people remedies for certain diseases,
				as can be seen in the Hadith in the Kitab at-Tib (Book of
				Cures).  But the cure can be beneficial and useful only
				by Allah's command and permission, otherwise if the cure
				and medical treatment were beneficial in every case, no
				one would have died in hospitals.  Now, if beside the
				cure and medical treatment, Allah's Word and His
				beautiful names also are made use of, or Word and His
				beautiful names also are made use of, or Allah is turned
				to and invoked for help by means of His Word, Names and
				Attributes in a place where no medical aid is available,
				it would not be against reason except for the
				materialists.  However, it is not right to disregard
				intentionally a cure or treatment where it is available,
				and recourse had only to enchanting and reciting of
				charms, and the people should start a regular practice of
				granting amulets as a means of earning their livelihood.
			</p>
			<p>
				Many people in this regard argue from Hadrat Abu Said
				Khudri's tradition which has been related in Bukhari,
				Muslim, Tirmidhi, Musnad Ahmad, Abu Daud and Ibn Majah,
				and it is supported also by a tradition related in
				Bukhari on the authority of Ibn Abbas.	According to it
				the Holy Prophet sent some of his Companions including
				Hadrat Abu Said Khudri on an expedition.  They halted on
				the way at the settlement of an Arabian tribe and
				demanded hospitality from the people, but they refused to
				extend any hospitality.  In the meantime the chief of the
				tribe was stung by a scorpion and the people came to the
				travelers to ask if they had any medicine or formula by
				which their chief could be cured.  Hadrat Abu Said said:
				"Yes, we do have, but since you have refused us
				hospitality, we would not treat him unless you promised
				us to give us something."  They promised to give them a
				flock of goats (according to some traditions, 30 goats),
				and Hadrat Abu Said went and started reciting Surah
				Al-Fatihah and rubbing his saliva on the affected place. 
				Consequently, the chief felt relieved of the effect of
				the poison and the people of the tribe gave them the
				goats as promised.  But the Companions said to one
				another; "Let us not make any use of the goats until we
				have asked the Holy Prophet about it", for they were not
				sure whether it was permissible to accept any reward for
				what they had done.  So they came before the Holy Prophet
				and related what had happened.	The Holy Prophet smiled
				and said: "How did you know that Surah Al-Fatihah could
				also be used for curing such troubles?	Take the goats
				and allocate my share also in it."
			</p>
			<p>
				But before one used this Hadith for permission to adopt a
				regular profession of granting amulets and reciting
				charms, one should keep in view the conditions under
				which Hadrat Abu Said Khudri had recourse to it, and the
				Holy Prophet not only held it as permissible but also
				said that a share for him also should be allocated so
				that there remained no doubt in the minds of the
				Companions that such a thing was permissible.  The
				conditions in Arabia in those days were, as they still
				are, that settlements were situated hundreds of miles
				apart, there were not hotels and restaurants where a
				traveler could buy food when he reached one of these
				after several days' journey.  Under such conditions it
				was considered a moral duty that when a traveler reached
				a settlement the people of the place should extend
				hospitality to him.  Refusal on their part in many cases
				meant death for the travelers, and this was looked upon
				as highly blameworthy among the Arabs.	That is why the
				Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) allowed as permissible
				the act of his Companions.  Since the people of the tribe
				had refused them hospitality, they too refused to treat
				their chief, and became ready to treat him only on the
				condition that they should promise to give them something
				in return.  Then, when one of them with trust in God
				recited Surah Al-Fatihah over the chief and he became
				well, the people gave the promised wages and the Holy
				Prophet allowed that the wages be accepted as lawful and
				pure.  In Bukhari the tradition related on the authority
				of Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas about this incident contains
				the Holy Prophet's words to the effect: "Instead that you
				should have acted otherwise, it was better that you
				recited the Book of Allah and accepted the wages for it."
				 He said this in order to impress the truth that Allah's
				Word is superior to every other kind of enchanting and
				practice of secret arts.  Furthermore, the Message also
				was incidentally conveyed to the Arabian tribe and its
				people made aware of the blessings of the Word that the
				Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) had brought from Allah.
				 This incident cannot be cited as a precedent for the
				people who run clinic in the cities and towns for the
				practice of secret arts and have adopted it as a regular
				profession for earning livelihood.  No precedent of it is
				found in the life and practice of the Holy Prophet (upon
				whom be peace) or his Companions, their followers and the
				earliest Imams.

		<section heading="Relation between Surah Al-Fatihah and the Mu'awwidhatayn">
			<p>
				The last thing which is noteworthy with regard to the
				Mu'awwidhatayn is the relation between the beginning and
				the end of the Quran.  Although the Quran has not been
				arranged chronologically, the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
				peace) arranged in the present order the verses and
				Surahs revealed during 23 years on different occasions to
				meet different needs and situations not by himself but by
				the command of Allah Who revealed them.  According to
				this order, the Quran opens with the Surah Al-Fatihah and
				ends with the Mu'awwidhatayn.  Now, let us have a look at
				the two.  In the beginning, after praising and glorifying
				Allah, Who is Lord of the worlds, Kind, Merciful and
				Master of the Judgment Day, the servants submits: "Lord,
				You alone I worship and to You along I turn for help, and
				the most urgent help that I need from You is to be guided
				to the Straight Way."  In answer, he is given by Allah
				the whole Quran to show him the Straight Way, which is
				concluded thus: Man prays to Allah, Who is Lord of dawn,
				Lord of men, King of men, Deity of men, saying: "I seek
				refuge only with You for protection from every evil and
				mischief of every creature, and in particular, from the
				evil whisperings of devils, be they from among men or
				jinn, for they are the greatest obstacle in following the
				Straight Way."	The relation that the beginning bears
				with the end, cannot remain hidden from anyone who has
				understanding and insight.
