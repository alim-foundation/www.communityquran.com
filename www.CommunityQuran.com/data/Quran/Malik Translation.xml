		<ayah num="1">
			Alif Lam M'im.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="2">
			This is The Book in which there is no doubt. (Since its Author,
			Allah, the Creator of this universe, possesses complete
			knowledge, there is no room for doubt about its contents.) It is
			a guide for those who are God conscious,
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="3">
			who believe in the Unseen, who establish Salah (five regular
			daily prayers) and spend in charity out of what We have provided
			for their sustenance;
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="4">
			who believe in this Revelation (The Qur'an) which is sent to you
			(O Muhammad) and the Revelations which were sent before you
			(Torah, Psalms, Gospel...) and firmly believe in the Hereafter.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="5">
			They are on True Guidance from their Rabb and they are the ones
			who will attain salvation.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="6">
			In fact, as for those who reject Faith; it is the same, whether
			you warn them or you don't, they will not believe.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="7">
			Allah has sealed their hearts and their hearing, their eyes are
			covered, and there is a grievous punishment for them.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="8">
			There are some people who say: "We believe in Allah and the Last
			Day" yet they are not true believers.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="9">
			They try to deceive Allah and the believers. However, they
			deceive none except themselves yet they do not realize it.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="10">
			There is a disease of deception in their heart; and Allah lets
			their disease increase, and they shall have painful punishment
			for the lies they have told.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="11">
			When it is said to them: "Do not make mischief on earth," they
			say: "We make peace."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="12">
			Be aware! They are the ones who make mischief but they do not
			realize it.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="13">
			When it is said to them: "Believe as the others believe" they
			sarcastically ask: "Should we believe like fools?" Be aware! They
			themselves are the fools, if only they could understand.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="14">
			When they meet the believers they say: "We are believers," but
			when they are alone with their shaitans, they say: "We are really
			with you, we were only mocking the believers."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="15">
			Allah will throw back their mockery on them and leave them alone
			in their trespasses; so they wander to and fro like blind.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="16">
			These are the people who barter guidance for error: but their
			bargain is profitless and they are not going to be guided.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="17">
			Their example is that of a man who kindled a fire; when it
			illuminated all around him Allah took away the light (their
			eyesight) and left them in utter darkness: they could see
			nothing.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="18">
			Deaf, dumb, and blind, they will never return to the Right Way.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="19">
			Or another example is that of a dark storm-cloud in the sky
			charged with thunder and lightning. They press their fingers into
			their ears at the sound of each stunning thunderclap for fear of
			death: Allah is encircling the unbelievers from all sides.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="20">
			The lightning terrifies them as if it was going to snatch away
			their eyesight; whenever it flashes they walk on; when it becomes
			dark, they stand still. And if Allah wanted He could have totally
			taken away their hearing and their sight; for Allah has power
			over everything.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="21">
			O Mankind! Worship your Rabb Who created you and created those
			who came before you; by doing this you may expect to guard
			yourself against evil.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="22">
			It is He Who has made the earth a floor for you and the sky a
			canopy; and it is He Who sends down rain from the sky for the
			growth of fruits for your sustenance. Therefore, do not knowingly
			set up rivals to Allah.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="23">
			If you are in doubt as to whether the revelations which We have
			sent to Our servant (Muhammad) are from Us or not, then produce
			one Surah like this; and call your witnesses (gods that you call
			upon) besides Allah to assist you, if you are right in your
			claim.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="24">
			But if you are unable to do so, and you can never do so, then
			fear the Hell fire, whose fuel is men and stones which is
			prepared for the unbelievers.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="25">
			Give glad tidings to those who believe in this Book and do good
			deeds in accordance with its teachings for them there will be
			Gardens beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they will be given
			fruits to eat they will say: "This is similar to the one we used
			to eat before on earth," for the fruits will resemble the fruits
			on the earth for their easy identification and enjoyment; and for
			them there will be chaste virgin spouses, and they shall live
			therein for ever.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="26">
			Allah does not mind using the similitude of a gnat or an even
			more insignificant creature to teach a lesson. Those who believe
			know that it is the truth from their Rabb; but the unbelievers
			say: "What does Allah mean by such a similitude?" By such a
			similitude Allah confounds many and enlightens many. He confounds
			none except the transgressors:
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="27">
			those who break Allah's Covenant after accepting it, and who cut
			aside what Allah has ordered to be united and cause mischief on
			earth. It is they who are the losers.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="28">
			How can you deny Allah? Did He not give you life when you were
			lifeless; and will He not cause you to die and again bring you to
			life; and will you not ultimately return to Him ?
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="29">
			It is He Who has created for you all that there is in the earth;
			and directed Himself towards the sky and fashioned it into seven
			heavens. He has perfect knowledge of everything.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="30">
			Note that occasion, when your Rabb said to the angels: I am going
			to place a vicegerent on earth. The angels said: "Will You place
			there one who will make mischief and shed blood while we sing
			Your praises and glorify Your name?" Allah said: "I know what you
			know not."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="31">
			He taught Adam the names of all things; then He presented the
			things to the angels and said: "Tell Me the names of those if
			what you say is true?" (Allah did this to show Adam's special
			qualities of learning and memory).
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="32">
			"Glory to You," they replied, "we have no knowledge except what
			You have taught us: in fact You are the One who is perfect in
			knowledge and wisdom."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="33">
			Allah said: "O Adam! Tell them the names." When Adam told them
			the names, Allah said: "Did I not tell you that I know the
			secrets of the heavens and the earth and I know what you reveal
			and what you conceal?"
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="34">
			When We ordered the angels: "Prostrate before Adam in respect,"
			they all prostrated except Iblees (Shaitan) who refused in his
			arrogance and became a disbeliever.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="35">
			To Adam We said: "Dwell with your wife in Paradise and eat
			anything you want from its bountiful food from wherever you wish,
			but do not approach this tree, or you shall both become
			transgressors."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="36">
			But Shaitan tempted them with the tree to disobey Allah's
			commandment and caused them to be expelled from Paradise, and We
			said: "Get out from here, some of you being enemies to others,
			and there is for you in the earth an abode and provisions for a
			specified period."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="37">
			Then Adam received appropriate words from his Rabb and repented,
			and Allah accepted his repentance. Surely Allah is the Most
			Forgiving, the Most Merciful.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="38">
			"Get out from here all of you," We said at the time of Adam's
			departure from Paradise. "There will come to you a guidance from
			Me, those who accept and follow it shall have nothing to fear or
			to regret.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="39">
			But those who reject and defy Our revelations will be inmates of
			Hellfire wherein they shall live forever."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="40">
			O children of Israel! Remember My favors to you; fulfil your
			covenant (firm Commitment) with Me and I will fulfil My covenant
			with you, that you should fear none but Me.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="41">
			Believe in My revelations, which are confirming your scriptures;
			do not be the first one to deny My revelations, and do not sell
			them for a petty price, fear Me and Me alone.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="42">
			Do not mix the Truth with falsehood, or knowingly conceal the
			truth.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="43">
			Establish Salah (prayers); give Zakah (charity); and bow down
			with those who bow down in worship.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="44">
			Would you ask others to be righteous and forget to practice it
			yourselves? Even though you read your Holy Book? Have you no
			sense?
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="45">
			Seek Allah's help with patience and Salah: it is indeed hard to
			be patient and to be punctual in offering Salah except for those
			who fear Allah,
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="46">
			who are certain in their mind that they are going to meet their
			Rabb and that they are going to return to Him for final
			judgement.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="47">
			O' Children of Israel! Remember the special favor which I
			bestowed upon You; that I exalted you above all other nations.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="48">
			Guard yourselves against the day on which one soul shall not
			avail another, no intercession shall be accepted, no ransom shall
			be taken and no help shall be given.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="49">
			Remember how We delivered you from the people of Fir'on
			(Pharaoh): they had subjected you to severe torment, killing your
			sons and sparing your daughters; you were facing a tremendous
			trial from your Rabb.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="50">
			And We parted the Red Sea for you, taking you to safety, and
			drowned Fir'on's people before your very eyes.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="51">
			Remember when We communed with Musa (Moses) for forty nights and
			in his absence you took the calf for worship, thus committing a
			wicked transgression.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="52">
			Even then We forgave you, so that you might become grateful.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="53">
			We gave Musa (Moses) the Holy Book (Torah) and the criterion of
			right and wrong so that you might be rightly guided.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="54">
			Remember when Musa returned with the Divine Book he said to his
			people: "O my people! You have indeed grievously wronged
			yourselves by taking the calf for worship; so turn in repentance
			to your Creator and slay the culprits among you; that will be
			best for you in His sight." He accepted your repentance; surely
			He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="55">
			Remember when you said: "O Musa! We shall never believe you until
			we see Allah with our own eyes," a thunderbolt struck you while
			you were looking on and you fell dead.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="56">
			Then We raised you up after your death; so that you might be
			grateful.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="57">
			And We even provided you the shade of clouds and sent down to you
			manna (sweet dish) and salva (quail meat) saying: "Eat of the
			good things We have provided for you;" in spite of these favors
			your forefathers violated our commandments. However, by violating
			our commandments they did not harm Us, but they harmed their own
			souls.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="58">
			Remember when We said: "Enter this town and eat whatever you wish
			to your hearts' content; make your way through the gates, with
			humility saying; 'we repent,' We shall forgive you your sins and
			We shall increase the provisions for the righteous among you.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="59">
			But the wrongdoers changed Our Words from that which they were
			asked to say, so We sent down a scourge from heaven as a
			punishment for their transgression.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="60">
			Remember the time when Musa (Moses) prayed for water for his
			people; We said: "Strike the rock with your staff." Thereupon We
			caused twelve springs to come out of that rock. Each tribe was
			assigned its own drinking-place. Then they were commanded: "Eat
			and drink of what Allah has provided and do not create mischief
			in the land."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="61">
			Remember when you said: "O Musa (Moses)! We cannot endure one
			kind of food; call on your Rabb to give us a variety of food
			which the earth produces, such as green-herbs, cucumbers, garlic,
			lentils, and onions. 'What?' Musa asked. 'Would you exchange the
			better for the worse? If that's what you want go back to some
			city; there you will find what you have asked for. Gradually they
			became so degraded that shame and misery were brought upon them
			and they drew upon themselves the wrath of Allah; this was
			because they went on rejecting the commandments of Allah and
			killed His prophets unjustly, furthermore, it was the consequence
			of their disobedience and transgression.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="62">
			Rest assured that Believers (Muslims), Jews, Christians and
			Sabians - whoever believes in Allah and the last day and perform
			good deeds - will be rewarded by their Rabb; they will have
			nothing to fear or to regret.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="63">
			Remember O Children of Israel when We took a covenant from you
			and when We lifted the Mount (Tur) over your heads saying: "Hold
			firmly to what We have given you (Torah) and follow the
			commandments therein, so that you may guard yourself against
			evil."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="64">
			But even after that you backed out; if there would not have been
			the grace and mercy of Allah upon you, you surely would have been
			among the losers.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="65">
			You very well know the story of those of you who transgressed in
			the matter of the Sabbath; We ordered them: "Be detested apes".
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="66">
			Thus, We made their fate an example to their own people and to
			succeeding generations, and a lesson to those who are
			God-conscious.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="67">
			Remember the incident when Musa (Moses) said to his people:
			"Allah commands you to sacrifice a cow," they replied, "do you
			ridicule us?" Musa answered, "I seek the protection of Allah from
			being one of the ignorant."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="68">
			"Request your Rabb," they said, "to give us some details of that
			cow". Musa replied: "Allah says, the cow should neither be too
			old nor too young but of middle age;" do, therefore, what you are
			commanded!
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="69">
			"Request your Rabb again" they said, "to clarify for us her
			color." Musa replied: "Allah says, the said cow should be of a
			rich and deep yellow color pleasing to the eyes."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="70">
			Again they said: "Request your Rabb to clarify for us the exact
			type of cow she should be, for to us all cows look alike; if
			Allah wills, we shall be rightly guided."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="71">
			Musa replied: "Allah says, the said cow should have neither been
			used to till the soil nor water the fields; a healthy one free
			from any blemish." "Now you have brought us the accurate
			description," they said. Then they slaughtered her, after they
			had nearly declined.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="72">
			And remember another incident when you killed a man and started
			disputing as to who killed him, Allah made it known what you
			concealed.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="73">
			So We said: "Strike the dead body with a piece of the slaughtered
			cow." That's how Allah brought the dead to life to show you His
			Signs so that you may understand His power to restore life.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="74">
			But even after seeing that your hearts became hard like a rock or
			even harder, for there are some rocks from which rivers gush out,
			and there are some which break asunder and water comes out of
			them, and there are some which fall down with the fear of Allah.
			And Allah is not unaware of what you do.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="75">
			Do you, O Believers, still hope that they will believe in what
			you say, when some of them have already heard the word of Allah
			and perverted it knowingly after they understood it?
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="76">
			When they meet the believers (Muslims) they say: "We too are
			believers," but when they (people of the Book) meet each other in
			private they say: "Would you disclose to the believers (Muslims)
			what Allah has revealed to you? So that they (Muslims) may use it
			as an argument against you in the court of your Rabb? Have you no
			sense?"
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="77">
			Do they not really know that Allah knows what they conceal and
			what they reveal?
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="78">
			Among them there are some illiterates who do not know their Holy
			Book; they follow their own desires and do nothing but
			conjecture.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="79">
			Woe to those who write the Book with their own hands and then
			say: "This is from Allah," so that they may sell it for a petty
			price! Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to
			them for what they have earned.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="80">
			The Jews say: "The fire shall not touch us except for a few
			days." O Muhammad, say: "Have you obtained such a promise from
			Allah which He would not break ? Or do you assert against Allah
			what you do not know?"
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="81">
			Yea! Those who commit evil and become encircled in sin are the
			inmates of Hellfire; they shall live there forever.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="82">
			As for those who believe and do good deeds, they will be the
			residents of Paradise and live there forever.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="83">
			Remember, We took a covenant (firm commitment) from the children
			of Israel: "You shall worship none but Allah; be good to your
			parents, relatives, orphans and destitute, speak fair to the
			people, establish 'Salah', and pay 'Zakah.'" But you broke the
			covenant, except a few of you, and you paid no heed.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="84">
			Also remember another covenant which We took from you: That you
			shall not shed blood among yourselves and you shall not expel
			your own people from your homes; you confirmed it and you are
			witness to it.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="85">
			Yet there you are, killing your own people, expelling a group
			amongst you from their homes, backing each other with sin and
			aggression; and if they come to you as captives, you trade them
			for ransoms whereas their expulsion was unlawful for you to begin
			with. Do you believe in a part of your Holy Book and reject the
			rest? So what other punishment do such people among you, who
			behave like this, deserve, than disgrace in this world and to be
			driven to grievous punishment on the Day of Judgment? Allah is
			not unaware of what you do.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="86">
			Such are the people who trade the life of this world at the
			expense of the Hereafter; so neither their punishment shall be
			lightened nor shall they be helped.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="87">
			To Musa (Moses) We gave the Book (Torah) and sent after him other
			Rasools in succession; then We gave Isa (Jesus), the son of
			Maryam (Mary), clear Signs and strengthened him with the Holy
			Spirit (Gabriel). Why is it that whenever there came to you a
			Rasool with a message which did not suit your desires, you became
			so arrogant that some you called impostors and others you killed!
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="88">
			They say: "Our hearts are in secure wrappers;" but the fact of
			the matter is that Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so
			little is that which they believe.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="89">
			Now when there has come to them a Book from Allah confirming the
			Holy Books of Torah and Gospel which they already have - even
			though before this they used to pray for victory against the
			unbelievers - when there came to them that which they very well
			recognize, they knowingly rejected it; Allah's curse is on such
			disbelievers.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="90">
			Ridiculous is the price for which they have sold away their
			souls, that they deny Allah's revelation merely because of their
			grudge, that Allah should send His grace (on an Israelite rather
			than ) on whom He pleases from His servants (Muhammad)! They have
			drawn on themselves wrath upon wrath, and for such disbelievers
			there is a disgraceful punishment.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="91">
			When they are asked to believe in what Allah has revealed, they
			reply: "we only believe in what Allah has sent to us (Torah), and
			we reject what is beside that," while it is the truth confirming
			their own scriptures! Ask them, "if you sincerely believe in what
			was sent to you , why did you kill the Prophets of Allah who were
			sent to you from amongst yourselves before?"
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="92">
			Musa (Moses) came to you with clear Signs, no sooner was he away
			from you, then you committed evil by worshipping the calf.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="93">
			Remember that when We took a Covenant from you and We lifted the
			Mount of Tur over your heads saying: "Take what We have given you
			firmly and listen to Our Commandments," you replied: "we have
			heard but we will not obey." So much was the love of that calf in
			their hearts due to their unbelief. O Muhammad, tell them: "If
			you are real believers, then why does your faith prompt you to do
			such evil things?"
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="94">
			Say O Muhammad: "If the Home of the Hereafter is exclusively for
			you and not for the rest of mankind, then wish for death if you
			are true in your claim!"
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="95">
			But they will never wish for death, because they are fully aware
			of the consequences of what they have sent before them for the
			Hereafter. And Allah knows the mentality of the wrongdoers.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="96">
			You will find them the greediest of men for life, even greedier
			than the mushrikin; each one of them wishes that he could be
			given a life of a thousand years; but the grant of such a life
			will not save them from the punishment, for Allah is watching
			whatever they do.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="97">
			Say O Muhammad: "Whoever is the enemy of Jibra'el (Gabriel)
			should know that he revealed this Qur'an to your heart by Allah's
			command, which confirms previous scriptures, and is a guidance
			and good news for the believers."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="98">
			Let them know that whoever is an enemy to Allah, His angels, His
			Rasools, Jibra'el (Gabriel) and Mika'el (Michael); Allah is an
			enemy to such unbelievers.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="99">
			We have sent down to you clear revelations: no one can deny them
			except the transgressors.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="100">
			Has it not been the case that every time they made a covenant a
			group of them threw it aside? But the fact is that most of them
			are faithless.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="101">
			Whenever there came to them a Rasool from Allah confirming their
			own Holy Book, a group from those to whom the Holy book were
			given cast off the Book of Allah behind their backs as if they

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="102">
			and accepted what the shaitans falsely attributed to the kingdom
			of Sulaiman; not that Sulaiman was an unbeliever, it was the
			shaitans who were unbelievers: they taught witchcraft to the
			people and that which was revealed to the two angels, Harut and
			Marut in the city of Babylon. Yet these two angels never taught
			magic to anyone without saying: "We have been sent to tempt you;
			do not renounce your faith." Inspite of this warning those people
			kept on learning, from the angels, the magic which could cause
			discord between husband and wife; although they could harm none
			with it except with Allah's permission. They learned, indeed,
			what harmed them and did not profit them; even though they knew
			fully well that the buyers of magic would have no share in the
			happiness of the Hereafter. Surely, they sold their souls for a
			bad price, if they could understand it!
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="103">
			If they would have believed (accepted Islam) and kept themselves
			away from evil, there would have been a better reward from Allah,

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="104">
			O Believers, do not say to our Rasool: "Ra'ina" (an ambiguous
			word for: "Listen, may you become deaf" or "Our shepherd" or in
			Judeo-Arabic language conveys the sense, "our evil one.") But say
			"Unzurna" ("look upon" us "or pay attention" to us) and listen to
			him carefully; and remember that there is a painful punishment
			for the unbelievers.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="105">
			The unbelievers among the People of the Book, and the Mushrikin,
			would never wish that any good be sent down to you, O Muhammad,

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="143">
			We have made you a moderate Ummah (nation) so that you may

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="144">
			O Muhammad, many a time We noticed you turning your face towards

			Allah is not unaware of what they do.
		</ayah>

			Even if you give every proof to the people of the Book, they will

			The Rasool has believed in the Guidance which has been revealed

			He is the One Who has revealed to you the Book. Some of its

			Those who are well grounded in knowledge say: "We believe in it;

			Indeed there was a sign (lesson) for you in the two armies which

		<ayah num="19">
			Surely the only Deen (true religion and the Right Way of life) in

		<ayah num="20">

			You are the best nation which has ever been raised for the

			Recite to them in all truth the story of Adam's two sons: How

		<ayah num="28">

		<ayah num="31">
			(He carried around the dead body of his brother and did not know
			what to do with it.) Then Allah sent a raven, which dug the
			ground to show him how to bury the dead body of his brother.
			"Alas!" He cried, "I failed even to be like this raven to find

		<ayah num="32">
			On account of that incident, We ordained for the Children of

			the Earth and whoever will save a life shall be regarded as if he
			gave life to all the human beings on the surface of the Earth.
			Yet, even though Our Rasools came to them one after the other
			with clear revelations, it was not long before, many of them
			committed excesses in the land.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="33">
			The punishment for those who wage war against Allah and His
			Rasool and strive to create mischief in the land is death or

		<ayah num="34">

		<ayah num="41">
			O Rasool! Do not grieve for those who plunge headlong into
			unbelief; those who say with their tongues: We believe, but have
			no faith in their hearts; and do not grieve for those Jews, who
			listen to lies and spy for other people who had never come to
			you. They tamper with the words of Allah and take them out of
			their context and say: "If you are given such and such
			commandment, accept it; but if it is other than this, reject it."
			If Allah intends to put anyone to trial, you have no authority in
			the least to save him from Allah. Such people are those whose

			humiliation in this world and a grievous punishment in the
			Hereafter.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="42">
			That is because they listen to falsehood and eat what is

			they will not be able to harm you the least, but if you do act as
			a judge, judge between them with fairness, for Allah loves those
			who judge with fairness.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="43">
			But why do they come to you for judgement when they have the
			Taurat which contains Allah's commandments? Yet they turn back
			after that. In fact, they are not true believers.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="44">
			Indeed We revealed the Taurat to Moses, in which there is
			guidance and light: By its laws, all the Prophets, who were
			Muslims, judged those who call themselves Jews and so did the
			rabbis and jurists of law. They were entrusted the protection of
			Allah's Book and they themselves were witnesses. Have no fear of
			people; fear Me, and do not sell My revelations for a petty
			price: those who do not judge by the law which Allah has
			revealed, are indeed kafirs (unbelievers).
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="45">
			We ordained in Taurat for them: "A life for a life, an eye for an
			eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth
			and for a wound an equal retaliation." But if anyone remits the
			retaliation by way of charity it will be an act of atonement for
			him; those who do not judge by the law which Allah has revealed,
			they are the wrongdoers.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="46">
			Then in the footsteps of those Prophets, We sent Isa (Jesus) the
			son of Maryam (Mary) confirming whatever remained intact from the
			Taurat in his time, and gave him the Injeel (Gospel) wherein was
			guidance and light, corroborating what was revealed in the
			Taurat; a guidance and an admonition to those who fear Allah.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="47">
			Therefore, let the people who follow the Injeel (Gospel) judge by
			the Law which Allah has revealed therein; those who do not judge
			by the Law which Allah has revealed, they are the transgressors.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="48">
			To you, O Muhammad, We have revealed this Book with the truth. It
			confirms whatever has remained intact in the scriptures which
			came before it and also to safeguard it. Therefore, judge between
			people according to Allah's revelations and do not yield to their
			vain desires diverging from the truth which has come to you. We
			have ordained a law and a Way of life for each of you. If Allah
			wanted He could have made all of you a single nation. But He
			willed otherwise in order to test you in what He has given you;
			therefore try to excel one another in good deeds. Ultimately you
			all shall return to Allah; then He will show you the truth of
			those matters in which you dispute.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="49">
			So, O Muhammad, pronounce judgement among them according to the
			law which Allah has revealed and do not follow their vain
			desires, and beware of them lest they tempt you away from a part
			of that which Allah has revealed to you. If they reject your
			judgement, then know that it is Allah's wish to scourge them for
			some of their sins. In fact most of the people are transgressors.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="50">
			By rejecting the Divine Law do they wish to be judged by the laws

		<ayah num="51">
			O believers! Take neither Jews nor Christians as your protecting

			Surely Allah does not guide the wrongdoers.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="52">
			You see that those who have the disease of hypocrisy in their
			hearts move around in their camp saying: "We fear lest a turn of
			fortune strike us." But soon when Allah gives you victory or a
			decision according to His will, they will regret for what they
			are hiding in their hearts.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="53">
			At that time the believers will say: "Are these the same people

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="54">
			O believers! Whoever among you renounce Islam let him do so; soon
			Allah will replace them with others whom He will love and they
			will love Him, who will be humble towards the believers, mighty
			against the unbelievers, striving hard in the way of Allah, and
			will have no fear of reproach from any critic. Now this is the
			grace of Allah which He bestows on whom He pleases. Allah has
			boundless knowledge.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="55">
			Your real protecting friends are Allah, His Rasool, and the

			O believers! Do not make your protecting friends those, from

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="58">
			When you call for Salah (prayers) they make it as an object of

		<ayah num="59">
			Tell them: "O people of the Book! What makes you against us other

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="60">
			Ask them: "Should I tell you of those who will have even worse

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="61">
			When they come to you they say: "We believe". But in fact,

		<ayah num="62">
			You will see many of them try to beat each other in sin and

		<ayah num="64">
			The Jews say: Allah's hand is tied up! - Nay! Their own hands

			surely make many of them increase in their wickedness and
			unbelief. We have stirred among them enmity and hatred till the
			Day of Resurrection. Every time they kindle the fire of war,

			in the land. Allah does not love those who do mischief.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="65">

			Certainly We took a covenant from the Children of Israel and sent

		<ayah num="72">
			Certainly they have disbelieved who say: "Allah is Christ the son

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="73">

		<ayah num="52">
			Do not drive away those (poor people like Bilal, Ammar and

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="109">
			These mushrikin solemnly swear by Allah that if a Sign came to

		<ayah num="112">

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="153">

		<ayah num="158">

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="41">
			Hell shall be their bed and flames shall be their covering. That

		<ayah num="42">
			As for those who believe and do good deeds - We never burden a

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="43">
			We shall remove whatever ill-feeling they may have in their

			and they will say: "Praise be to Allah Who guided us this way, we

			The Rasools of our Rabb have surely preached us the truth." At
			that time they will hear the announcement: "This is paradise,

		<ayah num="44">
			The residents of paradise will call out to the inmates of the

			them, "the curse of Allah be upon those wrongdoers
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="45">

			make it crooked, and who did not believe in the hereafter."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="46">
			Between the two, there shall be a veil, and on the A'raf
			(heights) there will be people who will recognize them by their

			have the hope."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="47">
			When their eyes shall turn towards the inmates of the hellfire
			they will say: "Our Rabb! Do not cast us among these wrongdoers."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="48">
			The people of the A'raf (heights) will call to certain men

			you?
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="49">
			Are the residents of paradise not the same people about whom you
			swore that Allah will never bestow His mercy on them?" Today the

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="50">
			Then the inmates of the fire will cry out to the residents of
			paradise: "Give us some water or some of the food which Allah has

			these things to the unbelievers,
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="51">

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="52">

		<ayah num="53">
			Now are these people waiting for anything other than the Day of

		<ayah num="54">
			Surely your Rabb is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="70">

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="89">

		<ayah num="104">
			Musa said: "O Fir'on! I am a Rasool from the Rabb of the worlds.

			Fir'on asked: "If you have come with a sign then produce it, if

		<ayah num="107">

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="109">
			The chiefs of Fir'on's nation said: "He indeed is a skilled

		<ayah num="113">
			The sorcerers came to Fir'on and said: "We must certainly have

		<ayah num="114">
			"Yes," he answered. "Not only reward but more: you shall

		<ayah num="124">

			The chiefs of Fir'on's (Pharaoh's) nation asked him: "Will you

			the ground the great works and fine buildings which Fir'on and
			his nation erected with such pride.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="138">
			We made the Children of Israel cross the (Red) sea. On their way

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="142">
			We summoned Musa to the mount of Tur for thirty nights and added

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="143">
			When Musa came to Our appointed place and his Rabb spoke to him,

			his Rabb manifested His glory on the mountain, it turned into
			small pieces of fine dust and Musa fell down unconscious. When
			Musa recovered he said: "Glory be to You! Accept my repentance

		<ayah num="146">

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="149">
			When they felt ashamed about what they had done and realized that

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="150">
			When Musa came back to his people, he was extremely angry and
			sorrowful, and he said: "What an evil thing you have done in my
			place in my absence! Have you tried to hasten the retribution of
			your Rabb?" He put down the Holy Tablets and seized his brother
			by the hair of his head and dragged him closer. Haroon (Aaron)

		<ayah num="155">

			Now, special mercy is assigned to those who follow the Rasool,

			O Muhammad, say: "O mankind! I am the Rasool of Allah towards all

		<ayah num="159">
			In the nation of Musa (Moses) there were some who guided others
			with the truth and thereby established justice.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="160">
			We divided them into twelve tribes, as nations; and when his
			thirsty people asked him for water, We revealed to Musa: "Strike
			the rock with your staff." Thereupon twelve springs gushed out
			from the rock, each tribe was specified its drinking place. We
			caused the clouds to cast shadow over them and sent down to them
			manna and salva for their food, saying: "Eat of the pure things
			We have provided for you," but they rebelled and by doing so they
			did not harm Us but they did injustice to their own souls.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="161">
			When it was said to them: "Reside in this town and eat therein
			whatever you please and say 'Hittatun' (forgive us) and enter the
			gate in a posture of humility; We will forgive you your sins and
			increase all the more the reward for such righteous people."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="162">
			But the wicked among them changed that word which was said to
			them, as a result We sent down a scourge upon them from heaven
			for their wrong doings.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="163">
			Ask them, about the town which was situated on the sea shore,
			what happened when they transgressed in the matter of Sabbath. On
			the day of their Sabbath the fish appeared before them on the
			surface of the water but on the days other than their Sabbath
			they never came near them; thus did We tempt them because they
			transgressed.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="164">
			Also remind them about the conversation among some of them, when
			some of them asked: "Why do you admonish a people whom Allah will
			destroy or sternly punish?" They replied: "To be able to offer an
			excuse before our Rabb, that we did discharge our duty, and also
			in the hope that they may refrain from His disobedience."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="165">
			However, when they disregarded the reminder, We delivered those
			who forbade evil and We overtook those who were wrongdoers with
			stern punishment because of their transgression.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="166">
			But when after that they persisted in their forbidden ways, We
			said to them: "Be detested apes."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="167">
			Also remind them when your Rabb declared that He would raise

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="168">
			We broke their unity as a nation and dispersed them into

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="169">
			Then they were succeeded by an evil generation. Who inherited the
			Book, they indulged in the vanities of this nether life, saying:
			"We expect to be forgiven" assuming that they are favorites of

			come their way they would again seize them. Was not a covenant

			O Prophet, remind mankind about incident when your Rabb brought

			your Rabb?" They all replied: "Yes! We bear witness that You
			are." This We did, lest you mankind should say on the Day of
			Resurrection: "We were not aware of this fact that You are our
			Rabb and that there will be a Day of Judgement.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="173">
			or lest you should say: "Our forefathers started the practice of

			They (Jews and Christians) say: "Allah has begotten a son!" Glory

			Quote to them the story of Nuh (Noah) when he said to his people:

		<ayah num="73">
			But they disbelieved him. As a result, We saved him and those of

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="74">
			Then after him We sent Rasools to their descendants. They came to

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="75">
			Then later on We sent Musa (Moses) and Haroon (Aaron) to Fir'on

		<ayah num="4">
			This is the narrative of that time, when Yusuf (Joseph) said to

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="5">
			He replied: "My dear little son! Do not say any thing about this

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="6">
			It will happen, as you have seen in your dream, that you will be

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="7">
			Indeed in the story of Yusuf and his brothers, there are signs
			for inquirers.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="8">
			This is how the story begins: his step brothers held a meeting
			and said to one another: "This Yusuf and his brother (Benjamin)
			are loved more by our father than us, even though we are a group
			of ten and can help him more than them. In fact, our father is
			clearly mistaken.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="9">
			Let us kill Yusuf or throw him out to some far-off land so that

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="10">
			At this one of them said: "Do not kill Yusuf, but if you must,
			throw him into some dark well, so that he may be picked up by
			some passing by caravan."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="11">
			After this meeting, they asked their father: "O our father! Why
			is it that you do not trust us with Yusuf, though we are his
			sincere well-wishers?
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="12">
			Send him with us tomorrow, that he may play and enjoy himself. We
			shall take good care of him."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="13">
			Their father said: "I will be worried if you take him away, for I
			fear lest a wolf should eat him up while you are off your guard
			."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="14">
			They said: "If a wolf could eat him despite our number, then
			surely we would be worthless people!"
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="15">
			When after such persistence they were able to take him away, they
			resolved to throw him into a dark well. We revealed this (to
			Yusuf) : "A time will come when you will admonish them about this
			act of theirs, now they do not perceive its consequences."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="16">
			At nightfall they return to their father, weeping.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="17">
			They said: "Father! We went off to compete in racing with one
			another, and left Yusuf by our belongings, and a wolf ate him !
			But you will not believe us even though we are telling the

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="18">
			As proof they brought his shirt stained with false blood. "No!"
			He cried, "Your souls have tempted you to evil. I need good
			patience! Allah Alone can help me bear the loss you are speaking
			of."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="19">
			On the other side, a caravan passed by, and sent a water carrier
			who let down his bucket into the well. Seeing Yusuf in it, he
			shouted with joy: "Good news! I found a young boy." They
			concealed him like trade merchandise. But Allah knew what they
			did.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="20">
			They (brought him to Egypt and) sold him for a petty price, a few
			dirhams (silver coins), they had such a low estimation of him.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="21">
			The Egyptian who bought Yusuf said to his wife: "Be kind to him.
			He may prove useful to us, or we may adopt him as a son." Thus We
			established Yusuf in the land and arranged to teach him the

			though most people do not know.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="22">
			When he reached maturity, We bestowed on him wisdom and

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="24">
			She advanced toward him, and he would have advanced towards her
			had he not seen a sign from his Rabb. Thus did We shielded him

			sincere devotee.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="25">
			They both rushed to the door. In order to stop him she caught his
			shirt, and as a result she ripped his shirt from behind. At the

			does someone who intended evil against your wife deserve except
			imprisonment or a painful chastisement?"
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="26">
			Yusuf said: "It was she who attempted to seduce me." At this -
			one accusing the other - one member of her own family bore
			witness saying: "If his shirt is ripped from the front, then she
			is speaking the truth and he is lying.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="27">
			But if it is ripped from behind, then he is speaking the truth
			and she is lying."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="28">
			So when he (her husband) saw that Yusuf's shirt was ripped from
			behind, he said to her: "It is one of the tricks of you women!
			Your trick was mighty indeed!
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="29">
			O Yusuf, say no more about this, and you (O my wife) seek
			forgiveness for your sins, for you were indeed the wrongdoer."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="30">
			The women of the city began to talk about this incident, saying:
			"The wife of Al-Aziz has seduced her young slave, for she has
			fallen madly in love with him. In fact, we see her in manifest
			error."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="31">
			When she heard about these remarks, she invited them and prepared
			for them a banquet, and gave each of them a knife. When they were
			engaged in cutting fruit, she asked Yusuf to come out before
			them. When they saw him, they were so amazed that they cut their
			hands and exclaimed spontaneously: "Good Lord! He is no human
			being; he is but a noble angel."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="32">
			She said: "Well, this is he about whom you blamed me. No doubt I
			seduced him, but he escaped. If he doesn't do what I say, he will
			certainly be thrown into prison and be disgraced."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="33">
			Yusuf said: "O my Rabb! I would rather go to prison than that to
			which they invite me; and unless You ward off their cunning snare
			from me, I may, in my youthful folly, feel inclined towards them
			and become one of the ignorant."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="34">
			Thereupon his Rabb granted his prayer and warded off their
			cunning snare from him; surely He hears all and knows all.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="35">
			Still, even after all the evidence they had seen (of his
			innocence and the guilt of their women), they thought it proper
			to send him to prison for a while.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="36">
			Two young men also entered the prison along with him. One day one
			of them said: "I saw in a dream that I was pressing wine." The
			other said: "I saw in a dream that I was carrying bread on my
			head, of which birds were eating." Tell us the interpretation of
			these dreams, for we see that you are a man of virtue.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="37">
			Yusuf replied: "I will, with Allah's permission, tell you the
			interpretation of these dreams before you are served the food you
			eat, this is part of the knowledge which my Rabb has taught me.
			In fact, I have forsaken the faith of those people who do not
			believe in Allah and even deny the hereafter.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="38">
			I follow the faith of my forefathers Ibrahim (Abraham), Ishaq

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="39">
			O my fellow inmates! Tell me what is better; many different lords

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="40">
			Those you serve besides Him are nothing but mere names which you

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="41">
			O my fellow inmates! (Here is the interpretation of your dreams),

			which you inquired (that is the answer to your question)."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="42">
			Then, to the one who he thought would be released, he said:
			"Mention me to your lord." But Shaitan made him forget to mention
			(Yusuf) to his lord, so he remained in the prison a few more
			years.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="43">
			One day the king of Egypt said: "I saw seven fat cows in my dream

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="44">
			They replied: "Confused nightmares! We are not skilled in the
			interpretation of dreams."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="45">
			Thereupon one of the two inmates who was released remembered
			Yusuf after all that time, and he said: "I will tell you its
			interpretation; just send me to Yusuf in the prison."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="46">
			He came to Yusuf in the prison and said: "O Yusuf the truthful
			one! Tell us the meaning of the dream of seven fat cows which are
			eaten up by seven lean ones and of seven green ears of corn and
			seven others dried up: so that I may return to the people and let
			them know the meaning of this dream."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="47">
			He replied: "You will cultivate for seven consecutive years.
			During this time you should leave the corn you reap in the ear,
			except what may be sufficient for your food.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="48">
			Then, after that period, there will come upon you seven hard
			years which will eat away all that you had stored except a little

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="49">
			After that period will come a year of abundant rain, in which the

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="50">
			The king said: "Bring this man to me." When the messenger came to
			Yusuf, he said: "Go back to your lord and ask him about the case
			of those women who cut their hands. Indeed my Rabb has full
			knowledge of their snare."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="51">
			The king questioned those women, saying: "What do you say about
			the incident when you attempted to seduce Yusuf?" They replied:
			"God forbid! We know of no evil on his part." The `Aziz's wife
			said: "Now that the truth has come to light, it was I who
			attempted to seduce him. In fact he is absolutely truthful."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="52">
			Yusuf said, "By this inquiry I meant to let him (Al-Aziz) know
			that I did not betray him in his absence, and that Allah does not
			let the snare of the treacherous succeed."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="53">
			"Not that I am free from sin - man's soul is prone to evil,

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="54">
			The king said: "Bring him to me; I will take him for my special

			on, you have an honorable place with us, and you will enjoy our
			full confidence."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="55">
			Yusuf said: "Place me over all the resources of the land.

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="56">

			Yet the reward in the hereafter will be even better for those who

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="58">
			Several years later when the famine started and there was no food

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="59">
			When he had given them their due provisions and they were about

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="66">
			Ya'qoob (Jacob) replied: "I will never send him with you until

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="67">

			While Yusuf was arranging the loading of their provisions, he put

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="72">

		<ayah num="76">
			After this Yusuf first began to search the packs of his

		<ayah num="77">
			At this accusation, his brothers remarked: "This is not strange

		<ayah num="80">

			You shall not kill your children for fear of want, for it is We
			Who provide sustenance for them as well as for you; surely

		<ayah num="32">
			You shall not commit adultery; surely it is a shameful deed and
			an evil way (opening the door to other evils).
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="33">
			You shall not kill anyone whom Allah has forbidden, except for
			just cause under the law. If anyone is killed unjustly, We have

		<ayah num="34">
			You shall not go near the property of an orphan, except with the

		<ayah num="36">
			You shall not follow anyone blindly in those matters of which you

		<ayah num="37">
			You shall not walk arrogantly on the earth, for you can neither

			All these and their evil aspects are hateful in the sight of your

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="39">
			This is but a part of the wisdom which your Rabb has revealed to
			you. Do not associate other deities as object of worship, lest
			you should be cast into hell, blameworthy rejected.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="40">
			What! Has your Rabb preferred to give you sons and adopted angels

		<ayah num="41">
			We have explained things in various ways in this Qur'an so that

		<ayah num="43">
			Glory be to Him! He is far above the things that they say about

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="44">
			The seven heavens, the earth and all beings therein declare His

		<ayah num="45">
			When you recite the Qur'an, We put a hidden barrier between you
			and those who do not believe in the hereafter.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="46">
			We cast a veil upon their hearts and make them hard of hearing,
			so they do not comprehend it. When in the Qur'an you mention His
			Oneness, they turn their backs in disgust.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="47">
			We are quite aware what they really wish to hear when they listen

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="48">
			See what sort of examples they make up about you! They have
			surely gone astray and cannot find the Right Way.

		<ayah num="49">
			They say: "What! When we are reduced to bones and dust, shall we

			they will ask: "Who will restore us?" Say: "The One Who created

			ask: "Well, when will this be?" Say, "It may be quite soon!
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="52">
			It will be on the Day when He will call you and you will raise up

			Say: "Pray if you will to those whom you assert besides Him; they

		<ayah num="57">

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="58">
			There is not a town but We shall destroy it before the Day of

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="59">
			We refrain from sending signs (miracles) only because the men of

			warning, and if people reject the sign after receiving it, they
			are doomed.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="60">
			Remember, O Muhammad! We told you that your Rabb encompasses

			fearful but it only increases their inordinate transgression.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="61">
			Recall the occasion when We said to the angels: "Prostrate

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="62">
			Then he asked: "Tell me, is this the one whom You have honored

		<ayah num="63">

		<ayah num="64">
			You may try to allure whomsoever you can with your seductive

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="65">

			Do you think that the Companions of the Cave and of Ar-Raqeem (this may refer to the name of their dog, or the tablet on which their names are inscribed or the mountain in which the cave is situated) were among Our wonderful signs?
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="10">
			When those young men took refuge in the cave, they said "Our Rabb! Have mercy on us from Yourself and guide us out of our ordeal."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="11">
			So We put upon their ears a cover (put them into a deep sleep) for a number of years in the cave,
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="12">
			and then awakened them to find out which of the two parties (believers and nonbelievers who were arguing about the fact of life after death) could best tell the length of their stay.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="13">
			Now We tell you their real story. They were young men who believed in their Rabb, and on them We had bestowed Our guidance.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="14">
			We put courage in their hearts when they stood up and declared: "Our Rabb is the Rabb of the heavens and the earth, we shall never appeal to any other deity except Him, for if we do, we shall be saying something improper.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="15">
			These people of ours have taken for worship other gods besides Him; if they are right, why do they not bring forth any convincing proof of their divinity? Who is more wicked than the one who invents a lie about Allah?"
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="16">
			Then in their mutual consultation they said: Now that we have withdrawn from them and denounced those deities whom they worship beside Allah, let us take refuge in some cave; our Rabb will extend to us His mercy and facilitate us in disposing of our affairs."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="17">
			If you could look at them in the cave, it would appear to you that the rising sun declines to the right of their cavern, and as it sets, passes them on the left, while they lay in an open space in between. This is from the signs of Allah. He whom Allah guides is rightly guided; but he whom He lets go astray, you will find no guardian to lead him to the Right Way.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="18">
			If you could see them, you might have thought them awake, though they were asleep. We turned them about to their right and left sides, while their dog lay stretched out with his forepaws at the entrance. Had you looked at them you would have certainly turned your back and their sight would have made you flee in terror.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="19">
			In the same miraculous way We woke them up from sleep so that they could question one another. One of them asked: "How long have you been here?" The others answered: "Maybe we have been here for a day or part of a day." Finally they concluded: "Our Rabb knows best how long we have stayed here. Anyhow let one of us go to the city with this silver coin, and let him find who has the purest food and bring us something to eat. Let him behave with caution and let him not disclose our whereabouts.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="20">
			For if they find you out, they will stone you to death, or force you back into their faith and in that case you will never attain felicity."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="21">
			Thus did We reveal their secret to the people so that they might know that the promise of Allah is true and that there is no doubt about the coming of the Hour of Judgement. (But what a pity that instead of considering the Hour of Judgement) they started arguing among themselves about the companions of the cave. Some said: "Erect an edifice over their remains." Their Rabb is quite aware of them. Those who finally prevailed over their matter said: "Let us erect a place of worship over them."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="22">
			Now some will soon say: "They were three and their dog was the fourth." The others will guess: "They were five and their dog was the sixth," and there are still others who will say: "They were seven and their dog was the eighth." Say: "My Rabb Alone knows their number. None but a few really know their correct number." Therefore, do not enter into discussion with them about their number except in a cursory way, nor ask anyone about the companions of the cave.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="23">
			Never say of anything "I will certainly do it tomorrow"
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="24">
			without adding: "If Allah wills!" And if you forget to say this, then call your Rabb to mind and say: "I hope that my Rabb shall guide me and bring me ever closer than this to the Right Way."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="25">
			Some say they stayed in their cave three hundred years and some add another nine.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="26">
			O Prophet, say: "Allah knows best how long they stayed; He is the One Who knows the secrets of the heavens and the earth; sharp is His sight and keen His hearing! They have no protector besides Him and He does not let anyone share in His command.

		<ayah num="27">
			O Prophet! Recite what has been revealed to you from the Book of your Rabb: no one is authorized to change His Words and if you dare to make any change, you will find no refuge to protect you from Him.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="28">
			Keep yourself content with those who call on their Rabb morning and evening seeking His good pleasure; and let not your eyes turn away from them desiring the attraction of Worldly Life; nor obey the one whose heart We have permitted to neglect Our remembrance, who follows his own desires and goes to extremes in the conduct of his affairs.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="29">
			O Prophet proclaim: "This is the Truth from your Rabb. Now let him who will, believe in it, and him who will, deny it." As for those who reject it, for such wrongdoers We have prepared a Fire whose flames will hem them in like the walls of a tent. When they cry for help, they will be showered with water as hot as molten brass, which will scald their faces. What a dreadful drink and what a horrible residence!

		<ayah num="30">
			As for those who believe and do good deeds, rest assured that We do not waste the reward of him who does a good work.

			They are the ones for whom there will be the Gardens of Eden, beneath which rivers flow; they will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold, they will wear green garments of fine silk and rich brocade and they will recline on soft couches.

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="32">
			O Prophet! Give them this parable. Once there were two men. To one of them We had given two gardens of grapevines surrounded with palm-trees and put between them land for cultivation.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="33">
			Both of those gardens yielded abundant produce and did not fail to yield its best. We had even caused a river to flow between the two gardens.

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="35">
			When, having thus wronged his soul, he entered his garden and said: "I do not think that this garden will ever perish!

		<ayah num="36">
			Nor do I believe that the Hour of Judgment will ever come. Even if I am returned to my Rabb, I will surely find even a better place than this."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="37">
			His companion replied while still conversing with him: "Do you disbelieve in Him Who created you from dust, from a drop of semen, and fashioned you into a perfect man?
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="38">
			As for myself, Allah is the One Who is my Rabb and I do not associate anyone with Him.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="39">
			When you entered your garden why did you not say: `It is as Allah pleased, no one has power except Allah!' Though you see me poorer than yourself in wealth and children,

		<ayah num="40">

			Or its' water may dry out and you may never be able to find it."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="42">
			It so happened that all his fruit produce was destroyed and the vines tumbled down upon their trellises, so he wrung his hands with grief for all that he had spent on it. He cried: "I wish I had not associated anyone with my Rabb!"
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="43">
			He was so helpless that he could neither find anyone to help him beside Allah, nor could he himself avert that catastrophe 
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="44">
			it was then that he realized that the real protection comes only from Allah. His is the best reward and His is the best requital.

		<ayah num="45">
			O Prophet! Give them the similitude of the life of this world. It is like the vegetation of the earth that flourishes with the rain from the sky, but afterwards the same vegetation turns into dry stubble which is blown away by the winds. Allah is the One Who has power over everything.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="46">
			Likewise, wealth and children are an attraction of this worldly life; yet honorable deeds that last forever are better rewarded by your Rabb and hold for you a better hope of salvation.

			You should prepare for that Day when We will set the mountains in motion and you will see the earth as a barren waste; when We shall assemble mankind all together, leaving not even a single soul behind.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="48">
			They all will be brought before your Rabb standing in rows and Allah will say: "Well! You see that you have returned to Us as We created you at first: even though you claimed that We had not fixed any time for the fulfillment of this promise of meeting with Us!"
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="49">
			Then the book of their deeds will be placed before them. At that time you will see the sinners in great terror because of what is recorded therein. They will say: "Woe to us! What kind of a book is this? It leaves out nothing small or large: all is noted down!" They will find all that they did recorded therein. Your Rabb will not be unjust to anyone in the least.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="50">
			When We said to the angels: "Prostrate yourself before Adam," all prostrated themselves except Iblees (Shaitan), who was one of the Jinns and chose to disobey the command of his Rabb. Would you then take him and his children as your protectors rather than Me, even though they are your enemies? What a bad substitute the wrongdoers have chosen!

		<ayah num="51">
			I did not call them to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor their own creation, nor do I take those who lead mankind astray as My supporters.

			We have given all kinds of examples in this Qur'an to make the people understand this Message, but man is exceedingly contentious.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="55">
			Nothing can prevent men from believing and seeking the forgiveness of their Rabb now that Guidance has come to them, unless they are waiting for the fate of former peoples to overtake them or the scourge to be brought to them face to face.

		<ayah num="56">
			We send the Rasools only to proclaim good news and to give warnings but with false arguments the unbelievers seek to defeat the Truth, through mocking at My revelations and My warnings.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="57">
			Who is more unjust than the one who, when reminded of the revelations of his Rabb, turns away from them and forgets what his own hands have done? In regards to such people, We have cast veils over their hearts, so they do not understand this Qur'an, and have become hard of hearing. Call them as you may towards the guidance, they will never be guided.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="58">
			Your Rabb is Most Forgiving, the Lord of Mercy. Had it been His Will to seize them for their sins, He would have hastened their punishment, but for that there is an appointed time, after which they will not find any refuge.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="59">
			All those nations whom We destroyed for their wrong doings were given respite and an appointed time for their destruction.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="60">
			Now tell them about the story of Khizr to whom Allah has given special knowledge. The Prophet Musa (Moses) was asked to go to him and learn from him. When Musa set out to meet him at an appointed place, he said to his young servant: "I will not give up my journey until I reach the junction of the two rivers, even if I have to spend ages in travel."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="61">
			It so happened that when at last they reached the junction of the two rivers they forgot about the fish they were carrying, which made its way into the river, and disappeared.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="62">
			When they had passed on some distance, Musa asked his young servant: "Let us have our breakfast, really we are worn out with this travelling."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="63">
			He replied: "You know! I forgot to tell you about the fish, which made its way miraculously into the river, when we were resting beside that rock. It was Shaitan who made me forget to mention this incident to you."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="64">
			Musa said: "That is the place we were looking for," so they went back retracing their footsteps.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="65">
			There they found one of Our servants (Khizr) whom We had blessed with special favor from Ourselves and whom We had given special knowledge of Our own.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="66">
			Musa requested of him: "May I follow you so that you may teach me from that True Knowledge which you have been taught?"
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="67">
			He answered: "Surely you will not be able to bear with me,
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="68">
			for how can you have patience about that which is beyond your knowledge?"
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="69">
			Musa said: "If Allah wills, you shall find me patient and I shall not disobey you in any way."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="70">
			He said: "If you want to follow me, then do not question me about anything until I tell you about it myself."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="71">
			So they set forth, but when they embarked in a boat to cross the river, Khizr made a hole in it. Musa cried out: "Did you make a hole in it to drown its passengers? You have done a weird thing!"
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="72">
			He said: "Didn't I say that you would not manage to have patience with me?"
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="73">
			Musa said: "Pardon my forgetfulness, do not be angry with me on account of this mistake." 
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="74">
			So they journeyed on until they met a boy, and Khizr slew him. Musa said: "You have killed an innocent person though he had killed nobody. Surely you have done a horrible deed!"
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="75">
			Khizr said: "Did I not tell you that you will not be able to bear with me?"
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="76">
			Musa replied: "If ever I ask you about anything after this, you may not keep me in your company; for then I should deserve it because you will have an excuse in my case".
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="77">
			They travelled on until they came to the people of a town. They asked them for some food, but they refused to receive them as their guests. There they found a wall on the point of falling down, so he restored it. Musa said: "If you wanted you could demand some payment for it!"
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="78">
			Khizr replied: "That's it, this is the parting between you and me. But first I will explain to you those acts of mine which you could not bear to watch with patience.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="79">
			As for the boat, it belonged to some poor fishermen who toiled on the river. I intended to damage it because in their rear there was a king who was seizing every boat by force.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="80">
			As for the youth, his parents are true believers, and we feared lest he would grieve them with his rebellion and unbelief.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="81">
			It was our wish that our Rabb should grant them another in his place, a son more righteous and better in affection.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="82">
			As for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city and beneath it their treasure was buried. Since their father was a righteous man, your Rabb desired that these children should attain their maturity and take out their treasure. All this was done as a mercy from your Rabb. What I did was not done by my own will. That is the interpretation of those actions which you could not bear to watch with patience".

		<ayah num="83">
			O Muhammad, they ask you about Zul-Qarnain. Say "I will recite to you some of his story".
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="84">
			Indeed We established his power in the land and We gave him all kinds of ways and means.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="85">
			So one time he followed a certain expedition towards the West and he marched on
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="86">
			till he reached the end of the land and the start of an ocean, where the Sun was setting, he noted that it was setting in a mucky spring and found by it a people. We said: "O Zul-Qarnain! You have the option to either punish them or to show them kindness".
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="87">
			He said: "Anyone Who will do wrong shall be punished; then will he return to his Rabb and be sternly punished by Him.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="88">
			As for him who believes and does good deeds, he will have a good reward and will be assigned an easy task by our command".
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="89">
			Then he set out on another expedition towards the East and marched on
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="90">
			till he came to the rising of the Sun, he noted it rising on a people for whom We had not provided any shelter from it (they were so backward that they did not even know how to make houses or tents for their living).
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="91">
			He left them as they were: We had full knowledge what priority was before him.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="92">
			Then he set out on another expedition and marched on
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="93">
			till he reached between two mountains where he found a people who could hardly understand his language.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="94">
			They requested: "O Zul-Qarnain! People of Gog and Magog ravage this land; should we pay you tribute in order for you to build a wall-barrier between us and them?"
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="95">
			Zul-Qarnain said: "That which my Rabb has granted me is more than enough, just help me with worker-force and I will erect a fortified barrier between you and them.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="96">
			Bring me panels of iron." Finally when he had dammed up the space between the two mountains, he said: "Ply your bellows." They did so until the iron wall became red hot, then he said: "Bring me some molten brass to pour over it."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="97">
			This became such a barrier that Gog and Magog could not scale it or to dig through it.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="98">
			He said: "This is a blessing from my Rabb. But you should know that when the promise of my Rabb shall come to pass, He will level it to the ground, for the promise of my Rabb is ever true."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="99">
			On that Day We shall let the people loose to surge like waves on one another. The trumpet will be blown and We shall assemble the mankind all together.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="100">
			We shall spread Hell out on display before the unbelievers,
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="101">
			who had turned a blind eye to My admonition and a deaf ear to My warning.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="102">
			Do the unbelievers think that they can take my servants as protectors, to save themselves from Hell, instead of Me? Certainly We have prepared Hell for the entertainment of such unbelievers.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="103">
			O Muhammad tell them: "Should we tell you the worst kind of losers relating to their deeds?
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="104">
			Those whose all efforts in this worldly life had gone astray from the Right Way, but all along they were under the delusion that they were doing good deeds;

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="106">
			Thus the reward of such people will be Hell; because they had no faith and because they took My revelations and My Rasools as a joke.

		<ayah num="107">
			However, those who believe and do good deeds, they will be entertained with the Gardens of Paradise

		<ayah num="109">

			O Muhammad, tell them: "I am but a human being like you; the revelation is sent to me to declare that your God is One God; therefore, whoever hopes to meet his Rabb, let him do good deeds and join no other deity in the worship of his Rabb."

		<ayah num="58">

		<ayah num="59">
			Musa replied: "Let it be the Day of Festival and let the people

		<ayah num="61">

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="62">
			Hearing this, they debated their case among themselves,

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="63">
			Finally they said: "These two (Musa and Haroon) are certainly

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="64">
			Therefore, muster up all devices and face them with a united

			" Whoever comes out victorious this day shall prevail."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="65">
			The magicians said: "O Musa! Will you throw down first or shall
			we?"
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="66">
			Musa replied: "Go ahead, throw down first". Suddenly it appeared

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="67">

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="68">
			We said: "Do not be afraid! You will surely come out on top.

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="70">
			When the magicians saw the serpent of Musa swallowing all their

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="71">
			Fir'on said: "How do you dare to believe in Him without my

			which one of us can give a more terrible and more lasting
			punishment."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="72">
			The magicians replied: "We can never prefer you, rather we prefer
			the miracle which we have witnessed and Him Who has created us.
			Therefore do whatever you will; you can only punish us in this

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="73">
			As for us, we have believed in our Rabb so that He may forgive us

		<ayah num="74">
			Surely he who will come to his Rabb as a sinner shall be

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="77">
			We sent Our revelation to Musa, saying: "Set forth with my

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="78">
			Fir'on followed them with his armies but the waters completely

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="80">
			O Children of Israel! We delivered you from your enemy, We fixed

		<ayah num="81">
			- saying: "Eat of the good things We have provided for your

			When Musa came to the mount Tur Allah said: "But, why have you

		<ayah num="84">
			He replied: "They are close behind me, I hastened to You O Rabb

		<ayah num="85">
			Allah said: "Well listen! We tested your people after you and the

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="86">
			So Musa returned to his people in a state of anger and sorrow. He
			said: "O my people! Did your Rabb not make a gracious promise to

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="87">
			They replied: "We broke the promise through no fault of ours. We

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="88">

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="89">
			What! Could they not see that it did not respond to them and that

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="90">
			Haroon had already told them: "O my people! This is but a test
			for you; for verily your Rabb is the Rahman (Allah): so follow me

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="91">
			They had replied: "We will not abandon its worship until Musa's

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="92">
			Then Musa addressed Haroon: " O Haroon! What prevented you from

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="93">
			Why did you disobey me?"
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="94">
			Haroon replied: "O son of my mother! Do not seize me by my beard

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="95">
			Then Musa addressed Samiri: "Now what you have to say about this,
			O Samiri?"
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="96">
			He replied: "I saw what they did not see, so I took a handful of
			dust from the footprint of the Rasool (Angel Gabriel) and threw
			it into the casting of the calf: thus did my soul prompt me."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="97">
			Musa cursed him: "Get out of here! Now through out your life, you

		<ayah num="122">
			Later on Adam repented and his Rabb chose him, accepted his

		<ayah num="124">

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="57">
			By Allah! I will certainly plan against your idols when you turn

		<ayah num="59">
			(On their return when they saw the plight of their idols), some

		<ayah num="62">
			When Ibrahim came, they asked, "O Ibrahim, are you the one who

		<ayah num="65">
			Confounded as they were, lowering their heads they said, "You

		<ayah num="67">

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="72">
			We gave him a son Ishaq (Isaac) and then a grandson Ya'qoob

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="73">
			We made them leaders who guided other people by Our command and

		<ayah num="76">

		<ayah num="78">
			We also bestowed favors upon Dawood (David) and Sulaiman

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="79">
			at that time We gave Sulaiman insight to arrive at the right

		<ayah num="80">
			We taught him the armor's craft, so that they might protect you

		<ayah num="81">

		<ayah num="82">

		<ayah num="83">
			Similarly We blessed Ayub, when he prayed to his Rabb saying, "I
			am badly afflicted with disease: but of all those who show mercy

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="84">
			We accepted his prayer and relieved his affliction, and restored

		<ayah num="85">
			Likewise, We blessed Isma`il (Ishmael), Idris and Zul-kifl, for

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="86">
			We admitted them to Our Mercy, for they were of the righteous

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="87">
			We blessed Zun-nun (Yunus / Jonah), when he departed in anger,

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="88">
			We accepted his prayer and delivered him from distress; thus do

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="89">
			We also blessed Zakariya, when he prayed to his Rabb, "O my Rabb!
			Do not let me remain childless even though You are the best of

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="90">
			We accepted his prayer and gave him Yahya (John), curing his wife
			for him to bear a child. They were ever quick in emulating good

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="91">
			And We blessed the woman (Maryam), who guarded her chastity, We

		<ayah num="98">

		<ayah num="5">
			O mankind! If you doubt that there is life after death remember

			Permission to fight back is hereby granted to the believers

		<ayah num="47">

		<ayah num="73">

		<ayah num="32">
			Get the singles among you married as well as those who are fit

			Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The parable of

			tree which is neither eastern nor western, its very oil would

			His message clear to the people; and Allah has knowledge of
			everything.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="36">
			His Light is found in those houses which Allah has sanctioned to

			by such people whom neither business nor business profit can

		<ayah num="38">

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="40">
			Or another parable of unbelievers' efforts is that of person

		<ayah num="41">
			Do you not see that Allah is the One Who is praised by all those

		<ayah num="42">
			To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; and

			When such people are called to Allah and His Rasool that He may

			The response of the true believers, when they are called to Allah

		<ayah num="52">
			Only those who obey Allah and His Rasool, have fear of Allah and

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="54">
			Say: "Obey Allah and obey the Rasool. If you do not, the Rasool

		<ayah num="55">
			Allah has promised those of you who believe and do good deeds

		<ayah num="58">
			O believers! Let your servants and those children who have not
			yet attained puberty ask your permission before coming in to see
			you on three occasions: before Fajr Salah (dawn prayer), at noon
			when you put off your clothes, and after the Isha Salah (night
			prayer). These are your three times of privacy. At other times,
			there is no blame on you if you, or they, go around visiting one
			another. Thus Allah makes His revelations clear to you, for Allah
			is All-Knowing, All-Wise.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="59">
			And when your children reach the age of puberty, let them still
			ask your permission as their elders do. Thus Allah makes His

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="60">
			There is no blame on such elderly women who have no interest in

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="61">
			There is no blame on the blind, nor there is blame on the lame,

			your sisters, or your paternal uncles, or your paternal aunts, or
			your maternal uncles, or your maternal aunts, or your sincere
			friends, or in houses with the keys of which you are entrusted.
			There is no blame on you whether you eat together or apart;
			however, when you enter the houses, you should greet one another
			with the greeting of peace prescribed by Allah blessed and pure.
			Thus Allah makes His revelations clear to you, so that you may
			grow in understanding.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="62">
			The true believers are only those who believe in Allah and His
			Rasool, and who, when gathered with him on a matter requiring

			truly believe in Allah and His Rasool - so when they ask your
			permission to leave and attend to theirs private business, you
			may give permission to those of them whom you deem appropriate
			and implore Allah to forgive them; surely Allah is Forgiving,

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="63">
			Do not consider the summoning of the Rasool in the same manner,

		<ayah num="64">
			Beware! Whatever is in the heavens and in the earth belongs to

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="23">
			Fir'on said: "Who is this Rabb of the Worlds?"

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="25">
			Fir'on said to those around him, "Do you hear that?"
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="26">
			Musa continued: "He is your Rabb and the Rabb of your

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="27">
			Fir'on interjected: "This Rasool of yours, who has been sent to

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="29">
			At this, Fir'on, who did not want to listen any more said: "If

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="30">
			At this, Musa said: "What if I show you a convincing sign?"

		<ayah num="31">
			Fir'on said: "Go ahead, show it if you are of the truthful."

		<ayah num="32">

		<ayah num="33">

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="34">

		</ayah>

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="50">
			They replied: "We don't care! We are going to return to our Rabb

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="51">

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="52">

			One day he entered the city at a time when its, people were not

			was from his own race and the other of his foes. The man of his
			own race appealed for his help against his foe, thereupon Musa
			gave his foe a blow which killed him. On seeing what he has done
			he said: "This is the work of Shaitan, surely he is an enemy that
			openly misleads."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="16">
			Then he prayed: "O my Rabb! I have indeed wronged my soul, please
			forgive me." So Allah forgave him, surely He is the Forgiving,

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="17">
			Musa promised: "O my Rabb! After this favor that You have

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="18">
			Next morning as he was walking in the city in fear and caution,
			suddenly he saw the same man who he had helped the day before
			cried out to him again for help. Musa replied: "You are certainly
			a misguided person."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="19">
			Then when Musa was about to lay his hands on a man who was an
			enemy to both of them, he cried out: "O Musa! Do you intend to
			kill me as you killed a person yesterday? You only want to become
			a tyrant in the land and have no intention of reforming
			anything."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="20">
			At that time, there came a man running from the other end of the
			city and said: "O Musa! The chiefs are plotting to kill you,
			therefore, run away, surely I am your well wisher."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="21">
			Hearing this, Musa left that place in fear and caution, praying:
			"O my Rabb! Deliver me from the nation of wrongdoers."
		</ayah>

			As he made his way towards Madyan, he said: "Soon my Rabb shall

		<ayah num="23">
			When he arrived at the well of Madyan, he saw a multitude of men
			watering their flocks, and besides them two women who were
			keeping their flocks back. He asked: "What is the problem?" They
			replied: "We cannot water our flocks until the shepherds take
			away their flocks from the water, because we are weak and our
			father is a very old man."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="24">
			So he watered their flocks for them and went back to the shade
			and prayed: "O Rabb! Surely I am in desperate need of whatever
			good that You may send down to me."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="25">
			Soon after that, one of the two women came to him walking
			bashfully and said: "My father is calling you. He wishes to
			reward you for watering our flocks for us." When Musa came to him
			and narrated his story, the old man said: "Have no fear. You have

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="26">
			One of the daughters said: "Father, hire this man. The best that

			on me. Allah is the witness to what we have agreed upon."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="29">
			After completing the term of his agreement, when Musa (Moses) was

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="30">

			Then Allah commanded, "Throw down your staff." When Musa saw that

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="32">
			Now put your hand into your pocket: it will come out shining

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="37">

			Fir'on said: "O Chiefs! You have no other god that I know of,

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="19">
			And the birds, too, with all their flocks, join in singing with

		<ayah num="20">
			We strengthened his kingdom and gave him wisdom and sound

		<ayah num="21">
			Have you heard the story of the two litigants who made an entry
			into his private chamber through climbing over the wall?
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="22">
			When they entered in upon Dawood and he became terrified. They
			said: "Have no fear, we are two litigants, one of whom has
			wronged the other. Judge rightly between us and do not be unjust,
			and guide us to the Right Way.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="23">
			This man is my brother; he has ninety nine ewes while I have only
			one ewe. Yet he says: `Turn her over to me' and he has the means
			to prevail against me in what he says."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="24">
			Dawood said: "He has certainly wronged you in seeking to add your
			ewe to his flock: in fact many partners are unjust to one
			another; except those who believe and do good deeds, and they are
			few indeed." - While he said this, Dawood realized that We had
			tested him ( Dawood had shown desire to one of his officers to
			divorce his wife so that he could marry her even though he
			already had 99 wives). So he sought forgiveness of his Rabb and
			fell down on his knees and turned to Allah in repentance.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="25">
			So We forgave his error. He will enjoy a place of nearness with
			Us and an excellent abode!
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="26">
			We said: "O Dawood! We have made you a vicegerent in the earth,
			so rule among the people with justice and do not follow your own
			desires lest they mislead you from the Way of Allah. As for those
			who go astray from the Way of Allah, they shall surely have a
			severe punishment because of forgetting the Day of Reckoning.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="27">
			We have not created the heaven and the earth and all that lies
			between them in vain. That is the fancy of the unbelievers. Such
			disbelievers should be aware of the hellfire.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="28">
			Should We treat those who believe and do good deeds like those
			who create mischief in the earth? Should We treat the righteous

		<ayah num="29">
			-- This Book (Al-Qur'an) which We have sent down to you (O

		<ayah num="30">
			To Dawood We gave Sulaiman (Solomon), an excellent devotee! Who

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="31">
			Worthy of mention is the incident when, one evening,

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="32">

			with a view to glorify my Rabb." In testing race of the steeds,
			when they disappeared from sight,
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="33">
			he commanded: "Bring them back to me." Then he began to pass his
			hand over their legs and necks with affection.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="34">
			Behold, We also put Sulaiman to test and placed a mere body on

			which may not be given to anyone after me. Surely You are the
			real Giver."
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="36">
			We accepted his prayer and subjected to him the wind, which blew

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="38">

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="39">
			We said to him: "This is Our gift: you may give or withhold to

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="40">
			Surely he has a place of nearness to Us and will have an
			excellent place of final abode.
		</ayah>

		<ayah num="44">
			Then, to fulfill his oath of giving his wife one hundred strikes

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="45">
			And mention Our devotees Ibrahim (Abraham), Ishaq (Isaac) and

			Certainly We have revealed to you the Book with the Truth:

		<ayah num="3">
			Beware! Sincere true obedience is due to Allah Alone! As for
			those who take other guardians (worship the saints) besides Him

			not guide him who is a liar and a disbeliever.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="4">
			If Allah had intended to take a son, He could have chosen anyone
			He pleased out of His creation: Glory be to Him! (He is above
			such things.) He is Allah, the One, the Irresistible.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="5">
			He created the heavens and the earth to manifest the Truth. He
			causes the night to succeed the day and the day to overtake the
			night. He has subjected the sun and the moon to His law, each one

			All-Mighty, the All-Forgiving?
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="6">
			He created you all from a single person, then from that person He

			Rabb. To Him belongs the sovereignty. There is no god but Him.
			How can you then turn away from Him?
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="7">
			If you disbelieve, then you should know that Allah does not need
			you. He does not like ingratitude from His servants. Therefore,
			if you are grateful He is pleased with you. On the Day of
			Judgement, no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another.
			Ultimately, all of you have to return to your Rabb. Then He will
			tell you the truth of all that you did in this life. Surely He
			knows even the secrets of your hearts.
		</ayah>
		<ayah num="8">
			When some trouble befalls man, he cries to his Rabb and turns to
			Him in repentance; but no sooner does He bestow on him His favor

		<ayah num="10">

		</ayah>
		<ayah num="22">

		<ayah num="30">
