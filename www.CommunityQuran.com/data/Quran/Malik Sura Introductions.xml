				It is one of the very earliest Revelations. In fact, we
				learn from authentic Traditions that it was the first
				complete S urah revealed to the Prophet (pbuh). Before
				this, only a few miscellaneous verses were revealed which
				form parts of S urah 'Alaq, Muzzammil and Muddaththir.

					This Surah is known as Sab'a Mathani (Seven Oft-Repeated
					Verses).
				</li>
				<li>
					It is also called Umm-ul-Kitab (Mother of the Book),
					foundation and essence of the Qur'an.
				</li>
				<li>
					It is a mandatory part of each Islamic Prayer (Salah),
					recited at least seventeen times daily in the five
					obligatory prayers.
				</li>
				<li>
					This Prayer is taught by Allah (Almighty God) Himself to

				This Prayer is for all those who want to study His
				Message. It is placed at the very beginning to teach the
				reader that if he sincerely wants to benefit from the
				Qur'an, he should offer this prayer to the Rabb of the
				Universe. Al-Fatiha teaches that the best thing for a man
				is to pray for "Guidance towards the Right Way" and to
				study the Qur'an with the mental attitude of a seeker of
				truth, and to recognize that the Rabb of the Universe is
				the source of all knowledge. They should, therefore,
				begin the study of Al-Qur'an with a prayer to Allah for
				Guidance.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is important to know that the real relation between
				Al-Fatiha and the Qur'an is not that of an introduction
				to a book but that of a prayer and its answer. Al-Fatiha
				is the prayer from the devotee and the rest of the Qur'an
				is the answer from Allah. The devotee prays to Allah to
				show the "Right Way" and Allah places the whole of the
				Qur'an before him in answer to his prayer, as if to say:
				"This is the Guidance that you have asked for".

				Though it is a Madni Surah (revealed at Madinah), it

				prayer, "This is the guidance that you have asked for."
				The greater part of Al-Baqarah was revealed during the
				first two years of the Prophet's life at Al-Madinah.

				Guidance is also provided concerning social, cultural,
				economic, political and legal issues through addressing
				the Jews who were acquainted with the Unity of Allah,
				Prophethood, Revelation, the Hereafter and angels. The
				Jews professed to believe in the law which was revealed
				by Allah to their Prophet Moses (pbuh), and in principle,
				their religion was the same (Islam) that was being taught
				by the Prophet Muhammad ( pbuh). Although they were
				originally Muslims, they had swerved from the real Islam
				and made innovations and alterations to their religion.
				As a result they had fallen victims to hair splitting and
				sectarianism, so much so that they had even given up
				their original name "Muslim" and adopted the name "Jew"
				instead, and made religion the monopoly of the children
				of Israel. This was their religious condition when the
				Prophet went to Al-Madinah and invited the Jews to the
				True Religion. More than one third of this Surah
				addresses to the Children of Israel. A critical review of
				their history, moral degeneration and religious
				perversions has been made, to draw clear lines of
				demarcation between the essentials and nonessentials of
				the True Religion. The Jews are warned not to mix up the
				Truth with Falsehood.
			</p>
			<p>
				During this period, a new type of Muslim called
				"Munafiqin" (hypocrite), had emerged. There were some who
				had entered the fold of Islam merely to harm it from
				within. There were others who were surrounded by Muslims,
				and had become "Muslims" to safeguard their worldly
				interests. They, therefore, continued to have relations
				with the enemies so that if the latter became successful,
				their interests would remain secure. Allah has,
				therefore, briefly pointed out the characteristics of the
				hypocrites in this Surah. Later on when their mischievous
				deeds became manifest, detailed instructions were given
				in Surah Al-Taubah.
			</p>
			<p>
				This Surah is an invitation towards the Divine Guidance.
				All of its stories, examples and incidents revolve round
				this central theme. This Surah particularly addresses the
				Jews and cites many events from their history to admonish
				and advise them that accepting the Guidance revealed to
				the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) is to their own advantage.
				They should, therefore, be the first to accept it because
				this Message is basically the same as that revealed to
				the Prophet Musa (Moses) pbuh.

				A.H. when the deputation from the Christians of Najran

				As in Surah Al-Baqarah, the Jews were invited to accept
				the guidance. Similarly, in this Surah, the Christians
				are admonished to give up their erroneous beliefs and
				accept the guidance of the Qur'an. At the same time, the
				Muslims are instructed to nourish the virtues that may
				enable them to carry out their obligation of spreading
				the Divine guidance.
			</p>
			<p>
				The believers had met with all sorts of trials and
				hardships about which they were forewarned in Surah
				Al-Baqarah. Though they had come out victorious in the
				Battle of Badr, they were not out of danger yet. Their
				victory had aroused the enmity of all those powers in
				Arabia which were opposed to the Islamic movement.
				Threatening events had begun to appear on all sides and
				the Muslims were in a perpetual state of fear and
				anxiety. This state of emergency was also adversely
				affecting its economy which had already been badly
				disturbed by the influx of Muslim refugees from other
				places.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Jewish clans, who lived in the suburbs of Al-Madinah,
				started discarding the treaties of alliance which they
				had made with the Prophet at his arrival from Makkah.
				They had discarded the treaties to the extent that during
				the Battle of Badr, these "People of the Book" sided with
				the mushrik Qureysh (in spite of the fact that their
				fundamental Articles of Faith - such as Oneness of Allah,
				Prophethood and life after death - were the same as those
				of the Muslims). After the Battle of Badr, they openly
				began to approach various Arab clans against the Muslims.
				The magnitude of the peril may be judged from the fact
				that even the life of the Prophet himself was always in
				danger. His Companions used to sleep in their armor and
				keep watch at night to guard against any sudden attack.
				Whenever the Prophet happened to be out of sight even for
				a short while, they would at once set out in search of
				him.
			</p>
			<p>
				Jews even approached the Qureysh and challenged their ego
				to avenge the defeat they had suffered at Badr and
				promised to help them from within. As a result the
				Qureysh marched against Al-Madinah with an army of 3000
				warriors and a battle took place at the foot of mount
				Uhud. The Prophet started out of Al-Madinah with one
				thousand men to fight the enemy. While they were marching
				to the battlefield, three hundred hypocrites deserted the
				army and returned to Al- Madinah to discourage the
				believers. A small band of hypocrites, however, remained
				among the seven hundred who accompanied the Prophet. They
				played their part and did their best to create mischief
				and chaos in the ranks of the Believers during the
				battle. This was the first clear indication of the fact
				that within the fold of the Muslim community there was
				quite a large number of saboteurs who were always ready
				to conspire with the external enemies to harm their own
				brethren.
			</p>
			<p>
				These devices of the hypocrites played a major role in
				the setback at Uhud, even though the weaknesses of the
				Muslims also contributed to it. The Muslims were a new
				community, formed on a new ideology and had not as yet
				gotten thorough moral training. Naturally in this second
				hard test of their physical and moral strength, some
				weaknesses came to the surface. That is why a detailed
				critical review of the Battle of Uhud is made in this
				Surah which was needed to warn the Muslims of their
				shortcomings and to issue instructions for their reform.

			<p>
				The main theme of this Surah is the building of a strong
				Islamic community. Guidelines are provided to the Muslims
				for uniting their ranks to be firm and strong.
				Instructions are given to stabilize the family structure,
				which is the nucleus of a strong community. Muslims are
				urged to prepare themselves for defense and to be the
				torchbearers of Islam. The importance of having a high
				moral character in building a strong community is
				emphasized.
			</p>
			<p>
				Guidelines for the smooth running of family life are
				provided and methods to settle family disputes are
				taught. Rules for marriage are prescribed and rights of
				wife and husband are assigned fairly and equitably. The
				status of women in the society is determined and the
				declaration about the rights of orphans is made. Laws and
				regulations are laid down for the distribution of
				inheritance. Instructions are given to reform the
				economic system. The foundation of criminal laws is laid
				down. Drinking is prohibited. Instructions are given for
				cleanliness and purification. The Muslims are taught what
				kind of relations they should have with their Rabb and
				with their fellow human beings. Instructions are given
				for the maintenance of discipline in the Muslim
				community.
			</p>
			<p>
				The moral and religious condition of the People of the
				Book is reviewed to teach lessons to the Muslims, and a
				warning is given to refrain from following in their
				footsteps. The distinctive features of hypocrisy and true
				faith are clearly marked for easy identification between
				the two. The setback in the Battle of Uhud had enabled
				the mushrik Arab clans, the neighboring Jews, and the
				hypocrites in Al-Madinah to threaten the Muslims from all
				sides. At this critical stage, Allah's grace filled the
				Muslims with courage and gave them the necessary
				instructions during that period. In order to counteract
				the fearful rumors that were being spread by the
				hypocrites, they were asked to make a thorough inquiry
				about their accuracy and then inform the appropriate
				leadership. Muslims were experiencing difficulties in
				offering their Salah during the expeditions when water
				was not available to perform ablution. In such
				circumstances Allah granted a permission to make Tayammum
				(purification with clean earth), and to shorten the Salah
				or to offer the "Salat-ul-Khauf," when they were faced
				with danger. Instructions were also given to those
				Muslims who were living in the enemy camps that they
				should migrate to Al-Madinah, the Islamic State.
			</p>
			<p>
				Clear instructions are also given regarding the
				hypocrites and nonbelligerent clans. On one hand, the
				superiority of Islamic morality and culture is
				established over that of the Jews, Christians and
				mushrikin; on the other hand, their incorrect religious
				concepts, immorality, and evil actions are criticized to
				prepare the ground for inviting them to the Right Way.

		<section heading="History">
			<p>
				Al-Ma'idah was revealed at the time when the last effort
				of the Qureysh to suppress Islam had been defeated in the
				Battle of the Ditch, and it had become quite obvious to
				the Arabs that no power could suppress the Islamic
				movement. Now Islam was not merely a creed which ruled
				over the minds and hearts of the people, but had also
				become a State which was regulating the lives of people.
				Therefore, there was a need to formulate Islamic civil
				and criminal laws in detail and enforce them through
				Islamic courts. New and reformed ways of trade and
				commerce were needed to replace the old. Likewise,
				Islamic laws of marriage and divorce, segregation of the
				sexes, and punishment for adultery, were needed to mold
				the social life of Muslims. This Surah provided the
				guidelines to the believers in some of these aspects of
				their lives so that their social behavior, conversation,
				dress, way of life and culture could take a definite
				shape of its own. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The treaty of Hudeybiyah was also signed in the same year
				which gave the Muslims not only peace in their own
				territory but, also respite to spread the Message of
				Islam in the surrounding territories. The Holy Prophet
				wrote letters to the rulers of Iran, Egypt, and Rome and
				to the Chiefs of Arabia, inviting them to Islam. At the
				same time the missionaries of Islam spread among the
				clans and tribes and invited them to accept the Divine
				Message of Al-Islam.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now that the Muslims had become a ruling body, it was
				feared that power might corrupt them. At this period of
				great trial, Allah had admonished them over and over
				again to stick to justice and to guard against the wrong
				behavior of their predecessors, the People of the Book.
				Believers are enjoined to remain steadfast to the
				Covenant of Obedience to Allah and His Rasool. They
				should follow Allah's commands and prohibitions in order
				to save themselves from the evil consequences which were
				faced by the Jews and the Christians who had violated
				them. They have been instructed to avoid hypocrisy. In
				continuation of the instructions given in Surah An-Nisa'
				about the consolidation of the Islamic Community, the
				Muslims have been directed to observe and fulfill all
				their obligations. The Jews and the Christians are also
				admonished to give up their wrong attitudes towards the
				Right Way and accept the guidance which is being taught
				by the Prophet Muhammad ( peace be upon him).

				The principal subject of this Surah is an invitation to
				the Divine Message sent down to Muhammad (pbuh). The
				Messenger had spent thirteen long years admonishing the
				people of Makkah without any tangible effect on them,
				because they had turned a deaf ear to his message and had
				become so antagonistic that Allah was about to command
				the Prophet to leave them alone and turn to other people.
				That is why they are being admonished to accept the
				message and a warning is given about the consequences of
				their wrong attitude. Now that the Prophet was about to
				receive Allah's commandment to migrate from Makkah, the
				concluding portion of the address has been directed
				towards the People of the Book with whom he was going to
				come into contact at Al-Madinah. During the course of the
				address to the Jews, the consequences of their
				hypocritical attitude towards the Prophets are also
				pointed out clearly, for they professed to believe in
				Prophet Musa (Moses) but their practices were opposed to
				his teachings. They were not only disobeying him but were
				in fact worshipping falsehood.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the end of the Surah, instructions are given to the
				Prophet and his followers to show patience and exercise
				restraint in answer to the provocations of their
				opponents. Since the believers were under pressure and
				stress, are advised to be very careful and not take any
				step that might harm their cause.

				This Surah was revealed in 2 A. H. after the battle of

			<p>
				The battle of Badr took place in the 2nd year of Hijrah,
				therefore, rules and regulations relating to peace and a
				critical review of war have been made in this Surah. But
				this review is quite different from the reviews that are
				usually made by worldly commanders after a great victory.
				Instead of gloating over the victory, the moral
				weaknesses that had come to the surface in that
				expedition have been pointed out as follows:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					The fact that the victory was due to the help of
					Allah rather than to their own valor and bravery
					has been stressed so that the Muslims should
					learn to rely on Him and obey Allah and His
					Rasool.
				</li>
				<li>
					The moral lesson of the conflict between the
					truth and falsehood has been explained.
				</li>
				<li>
					The mushrikin, the hypocrites, the Jews, and the
					prisoners of war are addressed in a very
					impressive manner advising them to learn a
					lesson.
				</li>
				<li>
					Instructions are given in regard to the spoils of
					war. The Muslims have been told not to regard
					these as their right but as a bounty from Allah.
					Therefore, they should accept with gratitude the
					share that is granted to them out of it and
					willingly accede to the share which Allah sets
					aside for His cause, for His Rasool, and for the
					help of the needy.
				</li>
				<li>
					It also gives normal instructions concerning the
					laws of peace and war, for these were urgently
					needed at the stage which the Islamic movement
					had entered. It enjoined that the Muslims should
					refrain from ways of ignorance whether they are
					in peace or in war and thus establish their moral
					superiority in the world.
				</li>
				<li>
					This Surah also states some articles of the
					Islamic Constitution which differentiate the
					status of Muslims living within the limits of
					Dar-ul-Islam (the Abode of Islam) from that of
					the Muslims living beyond its limits.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				In order to understand the circumstances and conditions
				which were being faced by the Muslim community and the
				Islamic State, in relation to which Divine guidance and
				laws were enacted, it is important to know how the battle
				of Badr took place.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Battle of Badr">
			<p>
				The message of Islam had proved its firmness and
				stability. However, the Muslims had not yet had an
				opportunity to demonstrate practically the blessings of
				the system of life based on Islam. There was neither any
				Islamic culture, nor any social, economic or political
				system; nor were there any established principles of war
				and peace. Therefore the Muslims had no opportunity for
				demonstrating those moral principles on which they
				intended to build their entire system of life; nor had it
				been proved on the touchstone of trial that the Muslims
				as a community were sincere in their proclamation of the
				message. Allah created opportunities for making up these
				deficiencies in Al-Madinah. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The people of Makkah had realized that Muhammad (pbuh),
				who had a great personality and possessed extraordinary
				abilities, was going to gain a strong footing in
				Al-Madinah. This would help integrate his followers -
				whose constancy, determination, and unwavering fidelity
				to Al-Islam had been tried - into a disciplined community
				under his wise leadership and guidance. They knew that
				this would spell death for their old ways of life. They
				also realized the strategic importance of Al-Madinah to
				their trade, which was their main source of livelihood.
				The Muslims could strike at the caravans travelling on
				the trade route between Yaman and Syria, and thus strike
				at the root of their economy. The value of the trade done
				by the people of Makkah on this route amounted to about
				two hundred thousand dinars annually. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In Sh'aban, 2 A. H. (February or March, 623 A. D.) a big
				trade caravan of the Qureysh , on its way back from Syria
				carrying goods worth over 50,000 dinars with a guard of
				thirty to forty men, reached the territory from where it
				could be easily attacked from Al-Madinah. As soon as the
				caravan entered the dangerous territory, Abu Sufyan, the
				caravan's leader, despatched a camel rider to Makkah with
				a frantic appeal for help. This caused great excitement
				and anger at Makkah. An army of approximately 1000
				warriors with great pomp and show marched towards
				Al-Madinah. They intended not only to rescue the caravan
				but also to put an end to the rising power of the Muslims
				and overawe the clans surrounding the route so as to make
				it absolutely secure for future trade. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Prophet, who always kept himself well informed, felt
				that the hour had come to take a bold step; otherwise the
				Islamic Movement would become lifeless with no chance to
				rise again. The condition of the Muslim community was
				still very shaky because the Muslim immigrants from
				Makkah (Muhajirin) had not been able to stabilize their
				economy; their helpers from the natives of Madinah, who
				became Muslims after the Prophet and his followers
				migrated there from Makkah (the Ansar), had not yet been
				tried; and the neighboring Jewish clans could not be
				trusted. Above all, the surrounding clans lived in awe of
				the Qureysh and had all their religious sympathies with
				them. Therefore, the consequences of the coming attack
				could not be favorable to the Muslims. A careful study of
				the situation indicated to the Prophet that he should
				take a decisive step and go into the battle with whatever
				strength he could muster and demonstrate whether the
				Muslim community had the ability to survive or was doomed
				to perish.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Holy Prophet's analysis of the situation was
				supported by Divine inspiration, therefore, he called the
				Muhajir and the Ansar to a meeting and placed the whole
				situation, without any reservation, before them, saying:
				"Allah has promised that you will confront one of the
				two, the trade caravan coming from the north or the army
				of the Qureysh marching from the south. Now, tell me
				which of the two you would like to confront!" The
				majority of the people replied that they should go for
				the caravan. When the Prophet repeated the same question,
				Miqdad bin 'Amr, a Muhajir, stood up and said: "O Rasool
				of Allah! Please march in the direction which Allah
				commands you; we will accompany you wherever you go. We
				will not say like the Israelites: 'Go you and your Rabb
				and fight, we will wait.' In contrast to them we say:
				'Let you and your Rabb decide; we will fight by your side
				to our last breath.'" Even then, he did not announce any
				decision, but waited for a reply from the Ansar who had
				not yet taken any part in any confrontation for Islam. As
				this was the first opportunity for them to prove that
				they were ready to fulfill their promise of fighting for
				the cause of Islam, he repeated the question without
				directly addressing them. At this, Sa'ad bin Mu'az, an
				Ansar, stood up and said: "O Rasool of Allah, it appears
				that you are addressing this question to us." When the
				Prophet said, "Yes," he replied, "We have believed in you
				and confirmed that what you have brought is the truth,
				and have made a solemn pledge with you that we will
				listen to you and obey you. Therefore, O Rasool of Allah,
				do whatever you intend to do. We swear by Allah Who has
				sent you with the truth that we are ready to accompany
				you to the seashore and if you enter it, we will plunge
				into it. We assure you that not a single one of us will
				remain behind or forsake you, for we will not hesitate at
				all to go to fight, even if you should lead us to the
				battlefield tomorrow. We will, Insha Allah (Allah
				willing), remain steadfast in the battle and sacrifice
				our lives for Islam. We do hope that by the grace of
				Allah our behavior will gladden your heart. So, trusting
				in Allah's blessing, take us to the battlefield." After
				this it was decided that they would march towards the
				army of the Qureysh and not towards the trade caravan. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The number of people who came forward to go to the
				battlefield was only a little more than three hundred (86
				Muhajirin, 62 from Aus, and 170 from Khazraj). Over and
				above that, this little army was ill-armed and hardly
				equipped for battle. Only a couple of them had horses to
				ride and the others had to take their turn in threes or
				fours on camel back. They had a total of 70 camels. Above
				all, they did not even have enough weapons for the
				battle; only 60 of them had armor. They marched straight
				to the southwest, wherefrom the army of the Qureysh was
				coming. This is also an indication that, from the very
				beginning, they had gone out to fight with the army and
				not to plunder the caravan. If they had aimed at
				plundering the caravan they would have taken the
				north-westernly direction rather than the southwest. The
				two parties met in combat at Badr on the seventeenth day
				of Ramadhan. When the two armies confronted each other
				and the Prophet noticed that the Qureysh army outnumbered
				the Muslims by three to one and was much better equipped,
				he raised his hands up in supplication and made this
				earnest prayer with great humility: "O Allah! Here are
				the Qureysh proud of their war material: they have come
				to prove that Your Rasool is false. O Allah! Now send the
				help that You have promised me. O Allah! If this little
				army of Your devotees is destroyed, then there will be no
				one left in the land to worship You." 
			</p>
			<p>
				In this combat the emigrants from Makkah were put to the
				hardest test because they had to fight against their own
				relatives, putting to the sword their fathers, sons,
				brothers, and uncles. It is obvious that only such people
				could do this who had accepted the truth sincerely and
				cut off all relations with falsehood. Similarly, the test
				to which the Ansar were put was not less hard. So far the
				Ansar had only alienated the powerful Qureysh and their
				allies by giving shelter to the Muslims against their
				wishes but now, for the first time, they were going to
				give fight to them and to sow the seeds of a long and
				bitter war with them. This meant that a small town of a
				few thousand inhabitants was going to wage a war with the
				whole of Arabia. It is obvious that only such people
				could take a stand who believed in the Truth of Islam so
				firmly that they were ready to sacrifice every personal
				interest for its sake. Allah accepted these sacrifices of
				the Muhajirin and the Ansar because of their true faith,
				and rewarded them with His help through angels.
			</p>
			<p>
				The proud, well-armed Qureysh were defeated by these
				ill-equipped devotees of Islam. Seventy men of the
				Qureysh army were killed and seventy captured as
				prisoners of war. Their arms and equipment came into the
				hands of the Muslims as spoils of war. All their big
				chiefs, who were their best soldiers and who had led the
				opposition to Islam, were killed in this battle. This
				decisive victory made Islam a power to be reckoned with.

				Now that the administration of the whole of Arabia had
				come into the hands of the believers, and all the
				opposing powers had become helpless, it was necessary to
				make a clear declaration of the policy which was to be
				adopted to make this newly formed Islamic state a perfect
				Dar-ul-Islam. In order to accomplish this objective, the
				following measures were taken:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					A declaration was made that all the treaties with
					the mushrikin were abolished and the Muslims
					would be released from the treaty obligations
					with them after the expiration of four months
					notice.
				</li>
				<li>
					A decree was issued that the guardianship of the
					Ka'bah should be taken away from the mushrikin
					and placed permanently in the hands of the
					believers (vv. 12-18), that all the customs and
					practices relating to the era of "ignorance"
					should be abolished, and that the mushrikin
					should not be allowed in the vicinity of the
					Ka'bah (v. 28). A decree was issued to crush the
					non-Muslim powers and force them to accept the
					sovereignty of the Islamic State. The object of
					Jihad was not to coerce them to accept Islam, as
					they were free to accept or not accept it. The
					object was to allow them the freedom to remain
					misguided, if they chose to be so, provided that
					they paid Jizya, the protection tax (v. 29), as a
					sign of their subjugation to the Islamic State.
				</li>
				<li>
					To ensure the stability of the Islamic State,
					gangs of the hypocrites who were being tolerated
					in spite of their flagrant crimes, were crushed.
					The Muslims were enjoined to treat them openly as
					disbelievers (v. 73). Accordingly, the		 
					    Prophet set on fire the house of Swailim,
					where the hypocrites used to gather for
					consultations in order to dissuade the people
					from joining the expedition of Tabuk. When the
					Prophet returned from Tabuk, he ordered pulled
					down and burned, the "masjid," which was being
					used by the hypocrites as a place for hatching
					plots against the true believers.
				</li>
				<li>
					Those people who lagged behind in the Campaign of
					Tabuk or showed the least negligence, were
					severely taken to task if they had no plausible
					excuse for not fulfilling that obligation. For
					there could be no greater internal danger to the
					Islamic community than weakness of faith,
					especially on the eve of a conflict with the
					whole non-Muslim world.
				</li>
				<li>
					A declaration was made that in the future, the
					sole criterion of an individual's true faith
					would be the exertion that individuals make for
					spreading the Word of Allah and the role they
					play in the conflict between Islam and Kufr.
					Therefore, if anyone shows any hesitation in
					sacrificing his life, money, time, and energies,
					his faith shall not be regarded as genuine. (vv.

				This Surah emphasizes invitation to the Message of Allah.
				It is an admonition and warning to the disbelievers. The
				invitation is to accept the Message of Allah, obey the
				Prophet of Allah, discard shirk, and worship Allah alone.
				Live your life in this world keeping in mind that you
				shall be held accountable for all of your actions on the
				Day of Judgement. The admonition is given through the
				example of those people who put their faith in and used
				their efforts for this worldly life and rejected the
				message of the Prophets. As a result, they met the evil
				consequences of their rejection. Therefore, people are
				advised to think seriously about whether or not they
				should follow the way of the arrogant, which history has
				proved to be the way to destruction. The warning is given
				to the disbelievers that they should not be deluded by
				the delay in the punishment of their misdeeds. The delay
				is only because of the respite that Allah has granted
				them, by His grace, to mend their ways. If they do not
				make use of this opportunity, they shall be inflicted
				with an inevitable punishment that will destroy all of
				them except the believers. Al-Qur'an has used the stories
				of the people of Nuh, Hud, Saleh, Lut, Shu'aib and Musa
				to achieve this purpose. The most prominent feature of
				these stories is to spell out how Allah passes His
				judgement on the people, He does not spare any
				disbeliever even if he/she may be a nearest relative of a
				Prophet of the time. The stories of Nuh and Lut clearly
				tell that even the Prophet's own son and wife were not
				spared for being disbelievers. Therefore, the believers
				should remember that real relationship is the
				relationship of faith.

				This Surah was revealed during the last stage of the
				Prophet's residence at Makkah. It was a time when the
				Qureysh were considering the question of killing,
				exiling, or imprisoning him. The Jews instigated the
				unbelievers to test the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) by asking
				him: "Why did the Israelites go to Egypt?" The history of
				the Israelites was not known to the Arabs, and the
				Prophet had no means knowing their traditions. Therefore,
				they thought that the Prophet would not be able to give a
				satisfactory answer, and thus, would be totally exposed.
				But, contrary to their expectations, the tables were
				turned on them, when Allah revealed the whole story of
				the Prophet Yusuf (Joseph) then and there. To their
				astonishment, the Prophet recited it to them on the spot.
				This put the Qureysh in a very awkward position because,
				it not only ruined their scheme, but also warned them by
				applying the example of Yusuf's brothers to their case,
				as to say, "As you are behaving towards this Prophet,
				exactly in the same way the brothers of the Prophet Yusuf
				behaved towards him; therefore, you should expect to meet
				with the same end."

					Yusuf's prayer to live and die as a Muslim.

				<li>
					The faith of Prophets Ibrahim (Abraham), Ishaq (Isaac),
					Ya'qoob (Jacob) and Yusuf (Joseph), may Allah's peace be
					upon them all, was the same as that of the Prophet
					Muhammad (pbuh) and they invited the people to the same
					Message to which Muhammad (pbuh) was inviting them.
				</li>
				<li>
					Characters moulded by Islam (based on the worship of
					Allah and accountability in the hereafter) are compared
					to characters moulded by disbelief and ignorance (based
					on the worship of false gods and the material world).
					Then the addressees are asked to decide for themselves
					between these two patterns.

				<li>
					It is made clear that, whatever Allah wills, He fulfills

				<li>
					The believers are advised to exert their efforts towards
					the Truth and put their trust in Allah. This will help
					them face their opponents with confidence and courage.
				</li>
				<li>
					Allah taught the believers through this story that one
					who possesses true Islamic character can conquer the
					world with the strength of his character. The marvellous
					example of the Prophet Yusuf shows how a man of high and
					pure character comes out successful even under the most
					adverse circumstances.
				</li>
				<li>
					Moreover, the revelation of this Surah accomplished the
					following two objectives: 
				</li>
				<ol>
					<li>
						It provided proof of Muhammad's (pbuh)
						Prophethood, and that his knowledge was not based
						on mere hearsay, but was gained through
						revelation. 
					</li>
					<li>
						It applied the theme of this story to the Qureysh
						and warned them that ultimately the conflict
						between them and the Prophet would end in his
						victory over them. As is stated in verse 7:
						"Indeed there are signs in this story of Yusuf
						and his brothers for the inquirers from among the
						Qureysh."
					</li>
				</ol>
			</ol>

			<p>
				In fact, by applying this story to the conflict between
				the Prophet and the Qureysh, the Qur'an had made a bold
				and clear prophecy which was fulfilled literally by the
				events that happened in the succeeding ten years. Hardly
				two years had passed after its revelation when the
				Qureysh, like the brothers of the Prophet Yusuf,
				conspired to kill the Prophet forcing him to emigrate
				from Makkah to Al-Madinah, where he gained power similar
				to that gained by the Prophet Yusuf in Egypt. Again, in
				the end, the Qureysh had to humble themselves before him
				just as the brothers of the Prophet Yusuf humbly
				requested, "Show mercy to us for Allah rewards richly
				those who show mercy," (Verse 88) and the Prophet Yusuf
				generously forgave them - though he had complete power to
				inflict his vengeance upon them. He said: "Today no
				penalty shall be inflicted on you. May Allah forgive you.
				He is the greatest of all those who forgive." (Verse: 92)
				The same story of mercy was repeated when, after the
				conquest of Makkah, the defeated Qureysh stood meekly
				before the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), who had full power to
				inflict his vengeance upon them for each and every
				cruelty committed by them. But instead, he merely asked
				them: "What treatment do you expect from me?" They
				replied, "You are a generous brother and the son of a
				generous brother." At this, the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)
				forgave them very generously, saying: "I am giving the
				same answer to your request that Yusuf gave to his
				brothers: "Today, no penalty shall be inflicted upon you:
				you are forgiven."

				The main theme of this Surah is that the Message of Allah

				The arguments in the whole Surah turns around this theme,
				and the basic components of the Message which are Tawhid

				repeated over and over again. People are invited to
				believe in these facts for their own good and if they

				This Surah not only provides reasoning to satisfy the

				This Surah was basically sent down in answer to the
				following three questions which the mushrikin of Makkah,
				in consultation with the Jews, had put to the Prophet in
				order to test him: 
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Who were "the Companions of the Cave?" 
				</li>
				<li>
					What is the real story of Khizr? 
				</li>
				<li>
					Who was Zul-Qarnain?
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				These three questions and the stories involved concerned
				the history of the Jews, and were unknown in Arabia.
				These questions were intended to test whether the Prophet
				was really Divinely guided or would try to avoid the
				questions. Allah not only provided a complete answer to
				their questions but also explained the three stories to
				the disadvantage of the opponents of Islam.
			</p>
			<p>
				The questioners were told that the Companions of the Cave
				believed in the same doctrine of Tawhid (Oneness of God)
				which was being put forward in the Qur'an and that their
				condition was similar to the condition of the persecuted
				Muslims of Makkah. On the other hand, the persecutors of
				the Companions of the Cave had behaved in the same way
				towards them as the disbelieving Qureysh were behaving
				towards the Muslims. Besides this, the Muslims have been
				taught that even if a believer is persecuted by a cruel
				society, he should not bow down before falsehood, rather
				he should migrate from that place if needed. The
				disbelievers of Makkah were told that the story of the
				'Companions of the Cave was a clear proof about the life
				hereafter. Allah has the power to resurrect after a long
				sleep of death as He did in case of the Companions of the
				Cave.
			</p>
			<p>
				The story of the Companions of the Cave is also used to
				warn the chiefs of Makkah who were persecuting the newly
				formed Muslim community. At the same time, the Prophet is
				being instructed that he should in no case make a
				compromise with the persecutors nor should he consider
				them to be more important than his poor followers. This
				story is also meant to comfort and encourage the
				oppressed Muslims and relate to them how righteous people
				in the past saved their Faith. On the other hand, the
				chiefs of Qureysh are admonished that they should not be
				puffed up with this transitory life that they are
				enjoying; rather they should seek the excellence of
				hereafter which will be permanent and eternal.

		<section heading="The Muslims' First Migration and its Historical Background">
			<p>
				The chiefs of the Qureysh had failed to suppress the
				Islamic movement through ridicule, sarcasm, and threats,
				so they resorted to persecution and economic pressure.
				They persecuted, starved, inflicted physical torture, and
				coerced the Muslims to give up Islam. The most pitiful
				victims of their persecution were the poor people and the
				slaves. Not only were they not paid by the Qureysh for
				labor and professional work but they were beaten,
				imprisoned, kept thirsty and hungry and were even dragged
				on the burning sands.	     
			</p>
			<p>
				The condition of the Muslims had become so unbearable
				that in the fifth year of the Prophet's mission, he
				advised his followers in the following words: "You may
				migrate to Habash, for there is a king who does not allow
				injustice to anyone. You should remain there till Allah
				provides a remedy for your affliction."
			</p>
			<p>
				Taking advantage of this permission, eleven men and four
				women immediately left for Habash. The Qureysh pursued
				them to the coast but fortunately they escaped by getting
				on a boat leaving for Habash at the seaport of Shu'aibah.
				After a few months, other people followed suit and their
				number rose to eighty-three men and eleven women from the
				Qureysh and seven from other clans. Only forty Muslims
				were left with the Prophet at Makkah. This migration
				started a great hue and cry in Makkah, for there was
				hardly any family of the Qureysh which did not lose a
				son, a son-in-law, a daughter, a brother or a sister.
				These included the near relatives of Abu Jahl, Abu Sufyan
				and other chiefs of the Qureysh who were notorious for
				their persecution of the Muslims. As a result, some of
				them became more bitter in their enmity toward Islam,
				while others were so moved by this that they embraced
				Islam. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Qureysh held a meeting and decided to send Abdullah
				bin Abi Rabiy'ah, the half brother of Abu Jahl, and Amr
				bin A's with some precious gifts to the king of Habash
				and persuade him to send the migrants back to Makkah.
				Sayyidah Umme Salmah, who became a wife of the Prophet
				later on and was among the migrants, related their story
				in detail. She says: "When these two clever statesmen of
				the Qureysh reached Habash, they distributed the gifts
				among the courtiers of the king and persuaded them to
				support their request to send the migrants back. Then
				they approached Negus, the king of Habash, presented the
				expensive gifts, and said: "Some headstrong brats of our
				city have come to your land so our chiefs have sent us to
				you with the request that you kindly send them back.
				These brats have forsaken our faith, have not embraced
				yours, and have invented a new faith." As soon as they
				made their request, all the courtiers supported their
				case, saying: "We should send such people back. It is not
				proper for us to keep them here." At this the king, who
				got annoyed, said: 'I am not going to send them back
				without proper enquiry. Since those people have put their
				trust in us through coming and taking shelter in my
				country rather than going to some other country, I will
				not betray them. I will send for them and investigate the
				allegations these people have made against them. Then I
				will make my final decision.'" So the king sent for the
				immigrants to come to his court.
			</p>
			<p>
				When the immigrants received the summons from the king,
				they held a meeting and after lengthy discussions
				decided: 'We shall present the teachings of the Prophet
				to the king without adding anything to or withholding
				anything from it regardless of whether he lets us remain
				here or turns us out of his country.' When they came to
				the court, the king put this question abruptly: 'I
				understand that you have given up the faith of your own
				people and have neither embraced my faith nor any other
				existing faith but have invented a new faith. I would
				like to know what your new faith is.' At this, J'afar bin
				Abi Talib responded on behalf of the immigrants, in these
				words: 'O king! We were sunk deep in ignorance and had
				become very corrupt; then Muhammad (pbuh) came to us as a
				Messenger of Allah and reformed us, but these Qureysh
				began to persecute us, so we have come to your country in
				the hope that here we will be free from persecution.'
				Hearing this statement, the king asked: 'Please recite a
				piece of the Revelation which your Prophet has received
				from Allah.' (In response, Sayyiduna J'afar recited a
				portion of this Surah which relates to the story of
				Prophets Yahya (John) and Isa (Jesus) may peace be upon
				them.) When the king listened, he started weeping and
				wept so much that his beard became wet with tears. When
				Sayyiduna J'afar finished the recital, he said: 'Most
				surely this Revelation and the Message brought by Jesus
				have come from the same source. By God, I will not put
				you in the hands of these people.'
			</p>
			<p>
				Next day Amr bin A's made another attempt. He went to the
				king and said: 'Please send for them again and ask them
				concerning the belief they hold about Jesus, for they say
				a horrible thing about him.' The king again sent for the
				immigrants, who had already learned about the scheme of
				Amr. They again held a meeting to discuss the answer they
				should give to the king if he should ask about the belief
				that they hold about Prophet Jesus. It was a very
				critical situation and all of them were uneasy about it;
				however, they decided that they would just say what Allah
				and His Rasool had said about Jesus. The next day, when
				they went to the king's court, he asked them the question
				that had been suggested by Amr bin A's. Sayyiduna J'afar
				bin Abi Talib stood up and answered without any
				hesitation: 'Jesus was a Servant of Allah and His
				Messenger. He was a Spirit and a Word of Allah which had
				been sent to virgin Mary.' At this the king picked up a
				straw from the ground and said, 'By God, Jesus was no
				different (even as much this straw) than what you have
				said about him.' After this the king returned the gifts
				of the Qureysh, saying: 'I do not accept bribes.' Then he
				addressed the immigrants: 'You are welcome in my country
				and you can stay here in peace.' 
			</p>
			<p>
				These incidents indicate that Allah sent this Surah as a
				"provision" to the immigrants for their journey to
				Habash. Following the story of Prophets Yahya and Isa,
				the story of the Prophet Ibrahim is also related for the
				benefit of the immigrants as he was also forced to leave
				his country by the persecution of his father, his family
				and his countrymen like them. On the one hand, it was
				intended to console the immigrants that by migrating they
				would be following the tradition of Prophet Ibrahim, so
				they could expect a good end similar as was his. On the

				This Surah begins with the object of The Qur'an's
				revelation that it is merely an admonition and guidance
				to the Right Path for those who fear Allah and want to
				save themselves from His punishment. This Qur'an is the
				Word of Allah Who is the Creator of the heavens and the
				earth and Godhead belongs to Him alone. These are the
				facts whether one believes them or not. After this
				introduction, the story of the Prophet Musa (pbuh) is
				related to admonish the people of Makkah who knew about
				Musa (pbuh) as a Prophet of Allah due to their relations
				with Jews and neighboring Christian kingdoms. This story
				has identified the following facts:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					The fundamental principles of Tawhid and the
					Hereafter which are being presented by the
					Prophet Muhammad, are the same as were conveyed
					by the Prophet Musa (pbuh) to his people.
				</li>
				<li>
					The Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) has been made a
					Rasool to convey Allah's Message to the people of
					Qureysh without worldly means, just as the
					Prophet        Musa (pbuh) was made a Rasool
					without worldly means to convey Allah's Message
					to a tyrant king, Fir'on.
				</li>
				<li>
					The people of Makkah were employing the same
					devices against the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) as
					Fir'on did against the Prophet Musa (pbuh), i.e.,
					frivolous objections, accusations, and cruel
					persecutions. Just as the Prophet Musa (pbuh)
					came out victorious over Fir'on, so shall the
					Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) over the Qureysh, for the
					mission which is supported by Allah always comes
					out victorious in the end.
				</li>
				<li>
					The Muslims are advised to follow the excellent
					example of the magicians, who remained steadfast
					in their faith, though Fir'on threatened them
					with horrible vengeance.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				After this the story of Adam is related, as if to tell
				the Qureysh, "the way you are following is the way of
				Shaitan, whereas the right way for a man is to follow his
				forefather Adam, who was seduced by Shaitan, but when he
				realized his error, he plainly confessed, repented and
				returned to the service of Allah."

				Examples have been cited from the life stories of the
				various prophets to show that all the prophets who were
				sent by Allah were human beings. They had no share in
				god-head and they had to implore Allah to fulfill each
				and every necessity of their lives. All the prophets had
				to pass through distress and affliction; their opponents
				did their best to thwart their mission, but in spite of
				it they came out successful with the help of Allah.
				Finally all the prophets had one and the same Deen (way
				of life), which is being presented by Muhammad (pbuh),
				and that is the only Right Way, while all other ways
				invented by human beings are utterly wrong.

				It appears that after the migration, when the month of
				Zul-Hijjah arrived, it brought to the immigrants the
				memories of their homes in Makkah, and naturally they
				must have thought about the Ka'bah and the Hajj
				congregation. These memories grieved them to think that
				the mushrikin Qureysh had debarred them from visiting the
				Sacred Mosque. Therefore, they might have been praying
				for and expecting Divine permission to wage war against
				those tyrants who had expelled them from their homes and
				prevented them from visiting the House of Allah. This
				Surah specifies the purpose for which the Ka'bah was
				built and clearly states that Hajj (pilgrimage) was
				enjoined for the worship of the One God (Allah). But it
				is an irony that it had been dedicated to the rituals of
				shirk, the worship of 360 idols and the real worshippers
				of One God (Allah) had been debarred from visiting it.
				Through this Surah, Allah also granted the Muslims
				permission to wage war against the tyrant mushrikin in
				order to oust them and establish the righteous way of
				life. According to Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Urwah bin Zubair,
				Zaid bin Aslam, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Qatadah and other
				great commentators, v. 39 is the first verse that granted
				the Muslims permission to wage war. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This Surah has also addressed the mushrikin of Makkah,
				the wavering Muslims, and the true believers as follows: 
			</p>
			<p>
				The mushrikin are warned in a forceful manner in these
				words: "You have persisted in your ignorance and trusted
				your deities instead of Allah, though they possess no
				power to protect you." They are also admonished time and
				again for their creed of shirk through providing sound
				arguments in favor of Tawhid (Oneness of God) and the
				Hereafter. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The wavering Muslims, who had embraced Islam but were not
				prepared to endure any hardship in its way, have been
				admonished in these words: "What is this faith of yours?
				You are ready to believe in Allah and become His servants
				provided you are given peace and prosperity, but if you
				meet with afflictions and hardships in His Way, you
				discard Allah and cease to remain His servants. You
				should bear in mind that this wavering attitude of yours
				cannot avert those misfortunes and losses which Allah has
				ordained for you."
			</p>
			<p>
				The true believers are told that the mushrikin of Makkah
				have no right to debar them from visiting the Ka'bah.
				They have no right to prevent anyone from performing Hajj
				because the Ka'bah is not their private property. This
				objection acted as an effective political weapon against
				the Qureysh because it posed this question: "Are the
				Qureysh mere attendants of the Ka'bah or its owners? This
				question implied that if the Qureysh succeeded in
				debarring the Muslims from Hajj without any protest from
				others, they would feel encouraged in the future to debar
				others who happened to have strained relations with the
				Qureysh. In order to emphasize this point, the history of
				the Ka'bah's construction is cited to show that it was
				built by the Prophet Ibrahim (pbuh) by the command of
				Allah and he had invited all of mankind to perform Hajj.
				That is why people coming from outside Makkah had enjoyed
				equal rights with the local people from the very
				beginning. It is also made clear that the House had not
				been built for the rituals of shirk but for the worship
				of One Allah. Thus it was sheer tyranny that the worship
				of Allah was being forbidden there while the worship of
				idols enjoyed full licence.

		<section heading="Social Reforms enacted in this Surah and their background:">
			<p>
				After the victory at Badr, the Islamic movement began to
				gain strength and at the Battle of the Trench, it had
				become clear that the united forces of the unbelievers,
				numbering over ten thousand, could not crush the Islamic
				movement. Both the parties understood well, that the war
				of aggression which the unbelievers had been waging
				against Muslims for several years, had come to an end. On
				that occasion the Prophet himself said to the believers:
				"After this year, the Qureysh will not be able to attack
				you; you will take the offensive against them."
			</p>
			<p>
				After the defeat in the Battle of the Trench the
				unbelievers realized that the Muslims could not be
				defeated on the battlefield and that the rise of Islam
				was not due to the numerical strength of the Muslims nor
				to their superior arms and material resources, since the
				Muslims were fighting against fearful odds on all these
				fronts. Their success was due to their moral superiority.
				The pure and noble qualities of the Prophet and his
				followers were capturing the hearts of the people, and
				were also binding them together into a highly disciplined
				community. As a result, they were defeating the mushrikin
				and the Jews both, therefore, they chose the moral front
				to carry on the conflict.
			</p>
			<p>
				They got the first opportunity when in Dhul-Qa'dah 5 A.H.
				the Prophet married Zainab (abph), the divorced wife of
				his adopted son, Zaid bin Harithah (abph). The Prophet
				married Zainab in accordance with the commandment of
				Allah to put an end to a custom of ignorance, which had
				given the same status to the adopted son as that of a son
				from one's own loins. The hypocrites, the Jews, and the
				mushrikin considered it a golden opportunity to exploit
				the situation to vilify the Prophet and to ruin his high
				reputation with a malicious slander through concocting a
				story in the following words: "One day Muhammad (pbuh)
				happened to see the wife of his adopted son and fell in
				love with her; he maneuvered her divorce and married
				her." Though this was an absurd fiction, it was spread
				with such skill and cunning that it succeeded in its
				purpose to the extent that some Muslim commentators also
				have cited some parts of it in their writings, and the
				orientalists have wilfully exploited it to vilify the
				Prophet. The fact is that Zainab (abph) was never a
				stranger to the Prophet. She was his first cousin, being
				the daughter of his real paternal aunt, Umaimah, daughter
				of Abdul Muttalib, his real grand father. He had known
				her from her childhood to her youth. Just one year before
				this incident, he himself had persuaded her to marry Zaid
				(abph), who was a slave and to whom the Prophet had freed
				and then adopted as his son, this was to demonstrate that
				in Islam, even a freed slave has rights equal to that of
				Qureysh. But Zainab (abph) could not reconcile her
				psychological reservation about marriage with a liberated
				slave. Therefore, she and her husband could not continue
				together for long, which inevitably led to their divorce.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second slander was made on the honor of Sayyidah
				Aeysha (abph), a wife of the Prophet, in connection with
				an incident which occurred while he was returning from
				the Campaign against the Bani Al-Mustaliq. This attack
				was even more severe than the first one and was the main
				reason for the revelation of this Surah. The mischief
				that was engineered by Abdullah bin Ubayy through this
				slander was to attack the honor of the Prophet and
				Sayyiduna Abu Bakr Siddiq (abph), who was the father of
				Sayyidah Aeysha (abph), to undermine the high moral
				superiority which was the greatest asset of the Islamic
				Movement and to ignite civil war between the Muhajirin
				and the Ansar, and between Aus and Khazraj, the two clans
				of the Ansar.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Laws &amp; Guidance">
			<p>
				This Surah was revealed to strengthen the moral fiber of
				the Muslim society, which had been shaken by the slander
				against Sayyidah Aeysha. The following laws and guidance
				are given to reform the Muslim community:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Rape, adultery and fornication which had already
					been declared to be social crimes in Surah
					Al-Ahzab (vv. 15,16) are now made criminal
					offences and the one proven guilty is to be
					punished.
				</li>
				<li>
					Muslims are enjoined to boycott adulterous men
					and women and are forbidden to have any marriage
					relations with them.
				</li>
				<li>
					One who accuses another of adultery but fails to
					produce four witnesses, is to be punished with
					eighty lashes.
				</li>
				<li>
					The law of Layan is enacted to provide the method
					for a husband to bear witness against his own
					wife in a case of adultery when there are no
					other witnesses, and also provides the wife a
					method to refute his testimony.
				</li>
				<li>
					The Muslims are enjoined to learn this lesson
					from the incident of the slander about Sayyidah
					Aeysha, and advise the Muslims as follows: "You
					should be very cautious about the charges of
					adultery against people of good reputation, and
					instead of spreading such a rumor, you should
					refute and suppress them immediately." In this
					connection, a general principle is enunciated
					that the proper spouse for a pure man is a pure
					woman, for he cannot get along with a wicked
					woman for long, and the same is the case with a
					pure woman. The Muslims are admonished as
					follows: "When you know that the Prophet is the
					purest of all human beings, how could you believe
					that he could live with a wicked woman and exalt
					her as the most beloved of his wives? For it is
					obvious that an adulterous woman could not have
					been able to deceive a pure man like the Prophet.
					You should have considered the fact that the
					accuser is a mean person while the accused is a
					pure woman. This should have been enough to
					convince you that the accusation is not worth
					your attention.
				</li>
				<li>
					Those who spread evil rumors and propagate
					wickedness in the Muslim community deserve
					punishment and not encouragement.
				</li>
				<li>
					Relations in the Muslim community should be based
					on good faith and not on suspicion: everyone is
					innocent unless he/she is proved guilty.
				</li>
				<li>
					People are forbidden to enter houses other than
					their own without seeking permission.
				</li>
				<li>
					Both men and women are instructed to lower their
					gaze when they come in contact with each other.
				</li>
				<li>
					Women are enjoined to cover their heads and
					breasts, not to display their beauty before other
					men except their servants or such relatives with
					whom their marriage is prohibited, hide their
					charms and not to put on jingling ornaments when
					they go out of their homes.
				</li>
				<li>
					Marriage is encouraged and enjoined even for
					slaves, because unmarried people are more prone
					to indecency.
				</li>
				<li>
					The institution of slavery is discouraged. Slave
					owners and other people are enjoined to give
					financial help to slaves to earn their freedom
					under the law of Mukatabat (contract).
				</li>
				<li>
					Prostitution by slave girls is forbidden, for
					prostitution in Arabia was confined to this class
					alone.
				</li>
				<li>
					Respect for privacy in home life is enjoined even
					for servants and children, including one's own.
					They are enjoined not to enter the private rooms
					of any man or woman without permission;
					especially in the morning, at noon and at night.
				</li>
				<li>
					Elderly women are given the concession that they
					can set aside their head covers when they are
					inside their homes but should refrain from
					display of adornments.
				</li>
				<li>
					The Muslims are encouraged to develop close
					relationships by taking their meals together.
					Nearest relatives and intimate friends are
					allowed to take their meals in each other's home
					without any formal invitation.
				</li>
				<li>
					Clear differences between believers and
					hypocrites are stated to enable every Muslim to
					discriminate between the two. At the same time
					the community is bound together by adopting
					disciplinary measures in order to make it
					stronger and firmer and to discourage enemies
					from creating mischief in it.

				Subject matter and topics of this Surah include the
				doubts and objections that were being raised by the

				At the end of the Surah a description of the character of

				This Surah begins with words of consolation to the
				Prophet, as if to say: "Why do you fret for their sake?
				If these people have not believed in you, it is not
				because they have not seen any sign, but because they are
				obstinate. The whole earth is full of signs that can
				guide a seeker of truth to reality, but stubborn and
				misguided people have never believed even after seeing
				the signs, whether these were the signs of natural
				phenomena or the miracles of the prophets. Such people
				always stick to their erroneous creeds until the Divine
				scourge actually overtakes them." Then the discussion is
				summed up, saying "O disbelievers, if you really want to
				see signs, why do you insist on seeing those horrible
				signs that visited the doomed nations of the past? Why
				don't you appreciate the Qur'an which is being presented
				in your own language? Why don't you appreciate Muhammad
				(pbuh) and his companions? Can the revelations of the
				Qur'an be the work of a Shaitan or a Jinn? Does the
				recipient of the Qur'an appear to be a sorcerer? Are
				Muhammad and his companions no different from a poet and
				his admirers? Why don't you give up disbelief and search
				your hearts for the Truth? When in your hearts, you
				yourselves believe that the revelations of the Qur'an
				have nothing in common with sorcery and poetry, then you
				shall find out that you are wrong and unjust."

		<section heading="Theme">
			<p>
				This Surah consists of the following two discourses.
			</p>
			<p>
				The theme of the first discourse is that the only people
				that can benefit from the guidance of The Qur'an and
				become worthy of the good promises made in it, are those
				who accept the realities of the universe presented in
				this Book, and then show obedience and submission in
				their practical lives. But the greatest hindrance for
				man's following this way, is the denial of the Hereafter.
				For it makes him irresponsible, selfish, and greedy in
				this worldly life, which in turn, makes it impossible for
				him to submit himself to God and to accept the moral
				restrictions on his lusts and desires.
			</p>
			<p>
				After this introduction, three types of character have
				been presented: Examples of the first type are Fir'on
				(Pharaoh), his chiefs, the nation of Thamud and the
				people of Prophet Lut (pbuh) who were all heedless of the
				Hereafter and consequently had become the slaves of their
				desires. That's why they did not believe even after
				seeing miracles. Rather, they turned against those who
				invited them to goodness and piety. They persisted in
				their evil ways, which were abhorred by every sensible
				person. They did not heed the admonition even moments
				before they were overtaken by the scourge of Allah.
			</p>
			<p>
				An example of the second type is Prophet Sulaiman
				(Solomon) (pbuh), who had been blessed by Allah with
				wealth, kingdom and grandeur far greater than the chiefs
				of the disbelievers of Makkah. But, since he regarded
				himself answerable before Allah and recognized that
				whatever he had was only due to Allah's bounty, he
				adopted righteousness and the attitude of obedience.
			</p>
			<p>
				An example of the third type is the Queen of Sheba, who
				ruled over the most wealthy and well-known people in the
				history of Arabia. She possessed all those means of life
				which could cause a person to become proud and arrogant.
				Her wealth and possessions far exceeded the wealth and
				possessions of the Qureysh. She professed shirk, which
				was not only an ancestral way of life for her, but she
				had to follow it in order to maintain her position as a
				ruler. Therefore, it was much more difficult for her to
				give up shirk and adopt the way of Tawhid than it could
				be for a common mushrik. But when the Truth became
				evident to her, nothing could stop her from accepting it.
				Her deviation was, in fact, due to her being born and
				brought up in a polytheistic environment, not because of
				her being a slave to her lusts and desires. Her
				conscience was not devoid of the sense of accountability
				before Allah.
			</p>
			<p>
				The theme of the second discourse is to draw the
				attention of the people to some of the most glaring and
				visible realities of the universe by asking questions
				such as: "Do the realities of the universe testify to the
				creed of shirk which you are following, or to the truth
				of Tawhid to which the Qur'an invites you?" After this
				the real malady of the disbelievers is pointed out,
				saying, "The thing which has blinded them and made them
				insensitive to every reality is their denial of the
				Hereafter. This same thing has rendered every matter and
				affair of life non-serious for them. For, according to
				them, when ultimately everything has to become dust, and
				the whole struggle of existence is to enjoy this worldly
				life then the truth and falsehood are equal and alike.
				Therefore, the question of whether one's system of life
				is based on right or wrong foundations becomes
				meaningless."
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, the invitation of the Qur'an to serve One
				God (Allah) is presented in a concise but forceful
				manner, and the people are admonished to accept this
				invitation as being to their advantage and rejection will
				be to their disadvantage. For if they deferred their
				faith before they saw those signs of Allah, after the
				appearance of which they would be left with no choice but
				to believe and submit. Then they should know that
				believing at that time will be of no avail.

			<p>
				This Surah removes the doubts and objections that were
				being raised against the Prophethood of the Prophet
				Muhammad (pbuh) and invalidates the excuses which the
				unbelievers had for not believing in him. Then the story
				of the Prophet Musa (pbuh) is related to emphasize that
				Allah is All-Powerful and can provide the means for
				whatever He wills to do. He arranged for the child Musa,
				through whom Fir'on was to be removed from power, to be
				brought up in Fir'on's own house thus Fir'on would not
				know whom he was fostering.
			</p>
			<p>
				The unbelievers wondered about Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) -
				how he could be blessed with Prophethood all of a sudden.
				This is explained through the example of the Prophet Musa
				(pbuh) who was given the Prophethood unexpectedly during
				a journey, while he himself did not know what he was
				going to be blessed with. In fact, he had gone to bring a
				piece of fire, but had returned with the gift of
				Prophethood.
			</p>
			<p>
				The unbelievers were wondering why Allah would assign the
				Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) this mission without any special
				help or supernatural forces to aid him. Again, the
				example of the Prophet Musa (pbuh) is used to explain
				that a person from whom Allah wants to take some service
				always appears without any apparent helper or force
				behind him, yet he can put up with much stronger and
				better-equipped opponents. The contrast between the
				strengths of Musa (pbuh) and those of Fir'on is far more
				extreme than that between Muhammad (pbuh) and the
				Qureysh; yet the whole world knows who came out
				victorious in the end and who was defeated.
			</p>
			<p>
				The unbelievers were referring to the Prophet Musa (pbuh)
				again and again, saying: "Why has Muhammad not been given
				the same which was given to Musa (pbuh)?" That is to say,
				the miracles of the Staff and the Shining Hand; as if to
				suggest that they would readily believe only if they were
				shown the kind of the miracles that Musa (pbuh) showed to
				Fir'on. The disbelievers are admonished, that those who
				were shown those miracles did not believe even after
				seeing the miracles. Instead they said: "This is nothing
				but magic," for they were full of stubbornness and
				hostility to the Truth just like the disbelievers of
				Makkah. Then a warning is given by citing the fate of
				those who disbelieved after witnessing those miracles.
				This was the background against which the story of the
				Prophet Musa was narrated and a perfect analogy is made
				in every detail between the conditions prevailing then in
				Makkah and those which were existing at the time of the
				Prophet Musa (pbuh).
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, the disbelievers of Makkah are admonished
				for mistreating those Christians who came to Makkah and
				embraced Islam after hearing the verses of the Qur'an
				from the Prophet. Instead of learning a lesson from their
				acceptance of Islam, the Makkans leader, Abu Jahl,
				humiliated them publicly. Then the real reason for not
				believing in the Prophet is mentioned. The disbelievers
				were thinking, "If we give up the polytheistic creed of
				the Arabs and accept the doctrine of Tawhid (Oneness of
				God), it will be an end to our supremacy in the
				religious, political and economic fields. As a result,
				our position as the most influential tribe of Arabia will
				be destroyed and we shall be left with no refuge anywhere
				in the land." This was the real motive of the chiefs of
				the Qureysh for their antagonism towards the Truth, and
				their doubts and objections were only a pretence invented
				to deceive the common people.

			<p>
				The prediction made in the initial verses of this Surah
				is one of the most outstanding evidences of the Qur'an
				being the Word of Allah. Research Scholar Abul A'la
				Maududi narrated the historical background relevant to
				this Surah as follows:
			</p>
			<p>
				"Eight years before the Prophet's advent as a Prophet,
				the Byzantine Emperor Maurice was overthrown by Phocus,
				who captured the throne and became king. Phocus first had
				the Emperor's five sons executed in front of him, and
				then had the Emperor killed and hung their heads in a
				thoroughfare in Constantinople. A few days after this, he
				had the empress and her three daughters also put to
				death. The event provided Khusrau Parvez, the Sassani
				king of Persia; a good moral excuse to attack Byzantine.
				Emperor Maurice had been his benefactor; with his help he
				had got the throne of Persia. Therefore, he declared that
				he would avenge his godfather's and his children's murder
				upon Phocus, the usurper. So, he started a war against
				the Byzantines in 603 A. D. and within a few years,
				putting the Phocus armies to rout in succession, he
				reached Edessa (modern, Urfa) in Asia Minor, on the one
				front, and Aleppo and Antioch in Syria, on the other.
				When the Byzantine ministers saw that Phocus could not
				save the country, they sought the African governor's
				help, who sent his son, Hercules, to Constantinople with
				a strong fleet. Phocus was immediately deposed and
				Hercules was made emperor. He treated Phocus as he had
				treated Maurice. This happened in 610 A. D., the year the
				Prophet was appointed to the Prophethood.
			</p>
			<p>
				The moral excuse for which Khusrau Parvez had started the
				war was no more valid after the deposition and death of
				Phocus. Had the object of his war really been to avenge
				the murder of his ally on Phocus for his cruelty, he
				would have come to terms with the new Emperor after the
				death of Phocus. But he continued the war, and gave it
				the color of a crusade between Zoroastrianism and
				Christianity. The sympathies of the Christian sects (i.
				e. Nestorians and Jacobians, etc.) which had been
				excommunicated by the Roman ecclesiastical authority and
				tyrannized for years also went with the Magian
				(Zoroastrian) invaders, and the Jews also joined hands
				with them; so much so that the number of Jews who
				enlisted in Khusrau's army rose to 26,000.
			</p>
			<p>
				Hercules could not stop this storm. The very first news
				that he received from the East after ascending the throne
				was that of the Persian's occupation of Antioch. After
				this, Damascus fell in 613 A. D. Then in 614 A.D., the
				Persians occupying Jerusalem, played havoc with the
				Christian world. Ninety thousand Christians were
				massacred and the Holy Sepulchre was desecrated. The
				Original Cross on which, according to Christian beliefs,
				Jesus had died, was seized and carried to Mada'in. The
				chief priest Zacharia was taken prisoner and all the
				important churches of the city were destroyed. How puffed
				up was Khusrau Parvez at this victory can be judged from
				the letter that he wrote to Hercules from Jerusalem. He
				wrote: "From Khusrau, the greatest of all gods, the
				master of the whole world : To Hercules, his most
				wretched and most stupid servant: 'You say that you have
				trust in your Lord. Why didn't then your Lord save
				Jerusalem from me?"
			</p>
			<p>
				Within a year after this victory, the Persian armies
				overran Jordan, Palestine and the whole of the Sinai
				Peninsula and reached the frontiers of Egypt. In those
				very days, another conflict of a far greater historical
				consequence was going on in Makkah. The believers in One
				God, under the leadership of the Prophet Muhammad (may
				Allah's peace be upon him), were fighting for their
				existence against the followers of shirk under the
				command of the chiefs of the Qureysh, and the conflict
				had reached such a stage that in 615 A. D., a substantial
				number of the Muslims had to leave their homes and take
				refuge with the Christian kingdom of Habash, which was an
				ally of the Byzantine Empire. In those days the Sassani
				victories against Byzantine were the talk of the town,
				and the pagans of Makkah were delighted and were taunting
				the Muslims to the effect: "Look the fire worshippers of
				Persia are winning victories and the Christian believers
				in Revelation and Prophethood are being routed
				everywhere. Likewise, we, the idol worshippers of Arabia,
				will exterminate you and your religion."
			</p>
			<p>
				These were the conditions when this Surah of the Qur'an
				was sent down, and in it a prediction was made, saying:
				"The Romans have been vanquished in the neighboring land
				and within a few years after their defeat, they shall be
				victorious. And it will be the day when the believers
				will rejoice in the victory granted by Allah." It
				contained not one but two predictions: First, the Romans
				shall be Victorious; and second, the Muslims also shall
				win a victory at the same time. Apparently, there was not
				a remote chance of the fulfillment of the either
				prediction in the next few years. On the one hand, there
				were a handful of the Muslims, who were being beaten and
				tortured in Makkah, and even till eight years after this
				prediction there appeared no chance of their victory and
				domination. On the contrary, the Romans were losing more
				and more ground every next day. By 619 A. D. the whole of
				Egypt had passed into Sassani hands and the Magian armies
				had reached as far as Tripoli. In Asia Minor they beat
				and pushed back the Romans to Bosporus, and in 617 A. D.
				they captured Chalcedony (modern, Kadikoy) just opposite
				Constantinople. The Emperor sent an envoy to Khusrau,
				praying that he was ready to have peace on any terms, but
				he replied, "I shall not give protection to the emperor
				until he is brought in chains before me and gives up
				obedience to his crucified god and adopts submission to
				the fire god." At last, the Emperor became so depressed
				by defeat that he decided to leave Constantinople and
				shift to Carthage (modern, Tunis). In short, as the
				British historian Gibbon says, even seven to eight years
				after this prediction of the Qur'an, the conditions were
				such that no one could even imagine that the Byzantine
				Empire would ever gain an upper hand over Persia, not to
				speak of gaining domination. No one could hope that the
				Empire, under the circumstances, would even survive.
			</p>
			<p>
				When these verses of the Qur'an were sent down, the
				disbelievers of Makkah made great fun of them, and Ubayy
				bin Khalaf bet Sayyiduna Abu Bakr ten camels that the
				Romans would not be victorious within three years. When
				the Prophet came to know of the bet, he said, "The Qur'an
				has used the words bid-i-sinin, and the word bid in
				Arabic applies to a number up to ten. Therefore, make the
				bet for ten years and increase the number of camels to a
				hundred." So, Sayyiduna Abu Bakr spoke to Ubayy again and
				bet a hundred camels for ten years.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 622 A. D., when the Prophet migrated to Madinah, the
				Emperor Hercules set off quietly for Trabzon from
				Constantinople via the Black Sea and started preparations
				to attack Persia from rear. For this he asked the Church
				for money, and Pope Sergius lent him the Church
				collections on interest, in a bid to save Christianity
				from Zoroastrianism. Hercules started his counter attack
				in 623 A. D. from Armenia. Next year, in 624 A. D., he
				entered Azerbaijan and destroyed Clorumia, the birthplace
				of Zoroaster, and ravaged the principal fire temple of
				Persia. Great are the powers of Allah, this was the very
				year when the Muslims achieved a decisive victory at Badr
				for the first time against the mushrikin. Thus, both the
				predictions made in Surah Rum were fulfilled
				simultaneously within the stipulated period of ten years.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Byzantine forces continued to press the Persians hard
				and in the decisive battle at Nineveh, (627 A.D.) they
				dealt them the hardest blow. They captured the royal
				residence of Dast-Gerd, and then pressing forward,
				reached right opposite to Ctesiphon, which was the
				capital of Persia in those days. In 628 A. D., in an
				internal revolt, Khusrau Parvez was imprisoned and 18 of
				his sons were executed in front of him and a few days
				later, he himself died in prison. This was the year when
				the peace treaty of Hudeybiyah was concluded, which the
				Qur'an has termed as "the supreme victory", and in this
				very year Khusrau's son, Qubad II, gave up all the
				occupied Roman territories, restored the True Cross and
				made peace with Byzantine. In 628 A. D., the Emperor
				himself went to Jerusalem to instal the " Cross" in its
				place, and in the same year the Prophet entered Makkah
				for the first time after the Hijrah to perform the
				Umra-tul-Q'adah.
			</p>
			<p>
				After this, no one could have any doubt about the truth
				of the prophecy of the Qur'an, with the result that most
				of the Arab polytheists accepted Islam. The heirs of
				Ubayy bin Khalaf lost their bet and had to give a hundred
				camels to Sayyiduna Abu Bakr Siddiq. He took them before
				the Prophet, who ordered that they be given away in
				charity, because the bet had been made at a time when
				gambling had not yet been forbidden by the Shari'ah; now
				it was forbidden. Therefore, the bet was allowed to be
				accepted from the belligerent disbelievers, but
				instruction given that it should be given away in charity
				and should not be brought in personal use".

				The main theme of this Surah is to remove doubts the

				sense and judge for themselves as to which of the things
				presented by The Qur'an are strange and novel: "Look at
				the administration of the heavens and the earth: consider
				your own creation and structure. Don't these things

				before you in the Qur'an? Does the system of the universe

				disbelief have been mentioned and the people exhorted to
				give up disbelief even before they meet their doom and
				accept the teaching of the Qur'an, which will be to their
				own advantage in the Hereafter. Then they are told that
				it is Allah's supreme Mercy that He does not seize man
				immediately for his errors to punish him finally and
				decisively. Instead he warns him beforehand by afflicting
				him with small troubles, hardships, calamities, losses
				and strokes of misfortune so that he may wake up and take

		<section heading="The Battle of the Trench Background">
			<p>
				Soon after the battle of Uhud Bani Asad started making
				preparations for a raid on Madinah. The Prophet sent an
				army of 150 warriors under the command of Sayyiduna Abu
				Salmah (the first husband of Sayyidah Umme Salmah). This
				army took Bani Asad by surprise and made them run in a
				panic leaving all their possessions behind. After this,
				Bani An-Nadhir, a Jewish tribe, plotted to kill the
				Prophet but their plot was discovered in time. The
				Prophet ordered them to leave Madinah within ten days and
				warned that anyone who remained behind after that would
				be put to death. Abdullah bin Ubayy, the chief of the
				hypocrites of Madinah, encouraged them to defy the order
				and refuse to leave Madinah. He even promised to help
				them with 2,000 men, and assured them that the Bani
				Ghatfan from Najd also would come to their aid. As a
				result, Bani An-Nadhir refused to follow the order and
				said that they would not leave Madinah no matter what. As
				soon as the time limit of ten days come to an end, the
				Prophet laid siege to their quarters, but none of their
				supporters had the courage to come to their rescue. At
				last, they surrendered on condition that every three of
				them would be allowed to load a camel with whatever they
				could carry and go away leaving the rest of their
				possessions behind. Thus, the entire suburbs of the city,
				which were inhabited by the Bani An-Nadhir, their
				gardens, their fortresses and other properties fell into
				the hands of Muslims.
			</p>
			<p>
				After this, the Prophet received information that the
				tribe of Bani Ghatfan was preparing for a war against
				Madinah. He marched against them with 400 Muslims and
				overtook them by surprise. As a result, they fled their
				houses without any struggle and took refuge in the
				mountains.
			</p>
			<p>
				After this in the month of Sh'aban A. H. 4, the Prophet
				went to the place of Badr with 1500 Muslims to fight
				against Abu Sufyan, who had challenged the Prophet and
				the Muslims at the end of the Battle of Uhud, saying: "We
				shall again meet you in combat at Badr next year." The
				Prophet accepted his challenge. From the other side, Abu
				Sufyan left Makkah with an army of 2,000 men, but did not
				have the courage to march beyond the town of
				Marr-Az-Zahran, now known as Wadi Fatimah. The Prophet
				waited for him at Badr for eight days; the Muslims during
				these days did profitable business with a trading
				caravan. This incident helped in restoring the image of
				the Muslims that had been tarnished at Uhud. It also made
				the whole of Arabia realize that the Qureysh alone could
				no longer resist Muhammad (pbuh).
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="The Battle">
			<p>
				The leaders of the Bani an-Nadhir, who had settled in
				Khayber after their banishment from Madinah, went around
				to the Qureysh, Ghatfan, Hudhail and many other tribes
				requesting them to gather all their forces and attack
				Madinah jointly. Thus, in Shawwal, A. H. 5, a very large
				army of the Arab tribes marched against the small city of
				Madinah. From the north came the Jews of Bani an-Nadir
				and Bani Qainuqah. From the east advanced the tribes of
				Ghatfan, Bani Sulaima, Fazarah, Murrah, Ashja, S'ad,
				Asad, etc. and from the south the Qureysh along with a
				large force of their allies numbering from ten to twelve
				thousand warriors. Had it been a sudden attack, it would
				have been disastrous. Before the enemy could reach
				Al-Madinah, the Prophet got a trench dug on the northwest
				of Madinah in six days and took up defensive positions
				with 3,000 warriors. Mount Salat was at their back, thick
				palm tree gardens were on their south, therefore, the
				enemy could not attack from those sides. The same was the
				case on the east side where there were lava rocks which
				were impassable for a large army to cross. The same was
				the case with the south- western side. The attack,
				therefore, could be made only from the eastern and
				western sides of the Uhud mountain, which the Prophet had
				secured by digging a trench. The disbelievers were not at
				all aware that they would have to encounter a trench
				outside Madinah. This kind of a defensive stratagem was
				unknown to the Arabs. Thus, they had to lay a long siege
				during winter for which they had not been prepared.
			</p>
			<p>
				The only alternative that remained for the disbelievers
				was to incite the Jewish tribe of Bani Quraizah, who were
				living in the southeastern part of the city to rebel. The
				Prophet had a treaty with them that in case of an attack
				on Madinah they would defend the city along with them. As
				a result, the Prophet had made no defensive arrangement
				in that area and had even sent Muslim families to take
				shelter in the forts situated on that side of the city.
				The invaders perceived this weakness in the defenses of
				the Muslim army. They sent a Jewish leader of the Bani
				An-Nadhir to the Bani Quraizah and induced them to break
				the treaty and join the war against the Muslims. In the
				beginning, they refused saying that they had a treaty
				with Muhammad (pbuh) who had faithfully abided by it and
				given them no cause for complaint. But, when Ibn Akhtab
				said to them, "Look, I have summoned a united force of
				entire Arabia against him. This is a perfect opportunity
				to get rid of him, if you lose it, you will never have
				another opportunity," thus, the anti-Islamic mind
				prevailed over every moral consideration and they agreed
				to violate the treaty.
			</p>
			<p>
				When the Prophet received this news, he at once asked the
				chiefs of the Ansar, to go and find out the truth. He
				advised them that if they found Bani Quraizah still loyal
				to the treaty, they should return and say so openly
				before the Muslim army; however, if they found that they
				were bent upon treachery they should only inform him so
				that the common Muslims would not panic. When inquired,
				Bani Quraizah openly told the chiefs: "There is no
				agreement and no treaty between us and Muhammad." At this
				they returned and submitted their report to the Prophet.
			</p>
			<p>
				After ascertaining verification, the Prophet, at that
				critical moment, initiated peace negotiations with the
				warrior tribe of Bani Ghatfan offering them one third of
				the fruit harvest of Madinah in lieu of their withdrawal.
				But when he asked S'ad bin Ubadah and S'ad bin Muadh,
				chief of the Ansar for their opinion about the conditions
				of peace, they asked, "O Rasool of Allah: Is it your
				personal wish that we should agree on these conditions,
				or is it Allah's Command that we have no option but to
				accept it, or, are you proposing this only to save us
				from the enemy?" The Prophet replied, "I am proposing
				this only to save you: I see that the whole of Arabia has
				formed a united front against you. I want to divide the
				enemy." At this, the two chiefs protested saying, "Your
				honor, if you want to conclude this pact for our sake,
				please forget it. These tribes could not subdue us under
				tribute when we were polytheists. Now that we have the
				honor of believing in Allah and His Rasool, will they
				make us sink to this depth of ignominy? Let the sword be
				the arbiter till Allah passes His judgement between them
				and us." With these words, they tore up the draft for the
				treaty which had not yet been signed.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the meantime Nu'aim bin Mas'ud, a member of the Ashja
				branch of the Ghatfan tribe, became a Muslim and came
				before the Prophet and submitted, "No one as yet knows
				that I have embraced Islam: You can take from me whatever
				service you please." The Holy Prophet replied: "Go and
				sow the seeds of discord among the enemy." So, first of
				all, Nu'aim went to the tribe of Quraizah with whom he
				was on friendly terms, and said to them, "The Qureysh and
				the Ghatfan can become wearied of the siege and go back,
				and they will lose nothing, but you have to live here
				with the Muslims. Just consider what your position will
				be if the matter turns out that way. Therefore, I would
				advise you not to join the enemy until the outsiders
				should send some of their prominent men as hostages to
				you." This had the desired effect upon the Bani Quraizah
				and they decided to demand hostages from the united front
				of the tribes. Then he went to the chiefs of the Qureysh
				and the Ghatfan and said to them, "The Bani Quraizah seem
				to be slack and irresolute. They may demand some men as
				hostages from you and then hand them over to Muhammad
				(upon whom be Allah's peace) to settle their affair with
				him. Therefore, be very firm and cautious in your dealing
				with them." This made the leaders of the united front
				suspicious of Bani Quraizah, and they sent them a
				message, saying, "We are tired of the long siege; let
				there be a decisive battle; let us, therefore, make a
				general assault simultaneously from both the sides." The
				Bani Quraizah sent back the word, saying, "We cannot
				afford to join the war unless you hand over some of your
				prominent men to us as hostages." The leaders of the
				united front became convinced that what Nu'aim had said
				was true. They refused to send hostages. And the Bani
				Quraizah, on the other side, also felt that Nu'aim had
				given them the correct counsel. Thus, the strategy
				worked: it divided the enemy against itself.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Victory granted by Allah without fight">
			<p>
				The siege was prolonged for more than 25 days. It was
				winter, and supply of food and water and forage was
				becoming more and more scarce. Division in the camp was
				also a great strain on the state of morale of the
				besiegers. Then, suddenly one night, a severe windstorm
				accompanied by thunder and lightning hit the camp. It
				added to the cold and darkness. The wind blew over the
				tents and put the enemy in disarray. They could not
				withstand this severe blow of nature. They left the
				battleground during the night and returned to their
				homes. When the Muslims awoke in the morning, there was
				not a single enemy soldier to be seen on the battlefield.
				The Prophet, finding the battlefield completely empty,
				said: "The Qureysh will never be able to attack you after
				this: now you will take the offensive." This was a
				correct assessment of the situation. Not only the Qureysh
				but the united front of all the enemy tribes had made
				their final assault against Islam and had failed. Now
				they could no longer dare invade Madinah; now the Muslims
				were on the offensive.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Raid on Bani Quraizah">
			<p>
				When the Prophet returned from the Trench, angel Gabriel
				came to him in the early afternoon with the Divine
				Command; the Muslims should not lay aside their arms
				without dealing with the Bani Quraizah. On receipt of
				this Command, the Prophet made the announcement:
				"Everyone who is steadfast in obedience should not offer
				his 'Asr Prayer till he reaches the locality of the Bani
				Quraizah." Immediately after this, he despatched
				Sayyiduna Ali with a contingent of soldiers as vanguard
				towards the Quraizah. When they reached there, the Jews
				climbed on to their roof tops and started hurling abuses
				on the Prophet and the Muslims, but their invectives
				could not save them from the consequences of their
				treachery. They had committed a breach of the treaty at
				the most critical moment of the war, joined hands with
				the invaders and endangered the entire population of
				Madinah. When they saw the contingent of Sayyiduna Ali,
				they thought that they had come only to overawe them. But
				when the whole Muslim army arrived under the command of
				the Prophet himself and laid siege to their quarters,
				they were very frightened. They could not stand the
				severity of the siege for more than two or three weeks.
				At last, they surrendered themselves to the Prophet on
				the condition that they would accept whatever decision
				Sayyiduna S'ad bin Muadh, the chief of the Aus, would
				give. They had accepted Sayyiduna S'ad as their judge
				because, in the pre-Islamic days, the Aus and the
				Quraizah had been confederates. They hoped that in view
				of their past ties, the people of the Aus also wished
				that Sayyiduna S'ad would treat their previous allies
				leniently. But Sayyiduna S'ad had just experienced and
				seen how the two Jewish tribes, who had been allowed to
				leave Madinah previously, had instigated the other tribes
				living around Madinah and summoned a united front of ten
				to twelve thousand men against the Muslims. He was also
				aware how treacherously this Jewish tribe had behaved on
				the occasion when the city was under attack threatening
				the safety of its entire population. He, therefore,
				decreed that all the male members of the Quraizah should
				be put to death, their women and children taken prisoners
				and their properties distributed among the Muslims. The
				sentence was carried out. When the Muslims entered their
				strongholds they found that these treacherous tribe had
				collected 1,500 swords, 300 coats of mail, 2,000 spears
				and 1,500 shields in order to join the war. If Allah had
				not helped the Muslims, all this military equipment would
				have been used to attack Madinah from the rear at a time
				when the polytheists were making preparations for a
				general assault on the Muslims after crossing the Trench.
				After this disclosure, there remained no doubt that the
				decision of Sayyiduna S'ad concerning those people, was
				the right decision.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Social Reforms">
			<p>
				In this Surah, the Islamic laws pertaining to marriage
				and divorce were complemented; the law of inheritance was
				introduced, drinking and gambling were prohibited, and
				new laws and regulations concerning economic and social
				life were enacted. 
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Status of adopted children">
			<p>
				The question concerning adoption was also addressed in
				this Surah. An adopted son was regarded as their own
				offspring by the Arabs at that time: he was entitled to
				inheritance; he was treated like a real son and real
				brother by the adopted mother and the adopted sister; he
				could not marry the daughter of his adopted father or his
				widow after his father's death. And the same was the case
				if the adopted son died or divorced a wife. The adopted
				father regarded the woman as his real daughter-in-law.
				This custom clashed in every detail with the laws of
				marriage and divorce and inheritance enjoined by Allah in
				Surahs Al-Baqarah and An-Nisa'. It made a person who
				could get no share in inheritance, entitled to it at the
				expense of those who were really entitled to it. It
				prohibited marriage between the men and the women who
				could enter into the contract of marriage. And, above
				all, it helped spread the immoralities which the Islamic
				Law wanted to eradicate. For a real mother, a real sister
				and a real daughter cannot be like the adopted mother,
				the adopted sister and the adopted daughter. When
				artificial relations endowed with customary sanctity are
				allowed to mix freely like the blood relations, evil is
				often the result. That is why the Islamic law of marriage
				and divorce, the law of inheritance and the law
				prohibiting adultery require that the concept and custom
				of regarding the adopted son as a real son should be
				eradicated. This concept however could not be uprooted by
				merely passing a legal order because centuries old
				prejudices and superstitions could not be changed by mere
				word of mouth. Therefore, a little before the Battle of
				the Trench, the Prophet was asked by Allah to marry
				Sayyidah Zainab, the divorced wife of his adopted son,
				Zaid bin Harithah (may Allah be pleased with him). The
				Holy Prophet acted on this Commandment during the siege
				of Bani Quraizah. 
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Defamatory remarks by the Jews, Pagans and Hypocrites">
			<p>
				As soon as the marriage was contracted, there arose a
				storm of propaganda against the Prophet. The polytheists,
				the hypocrites and the Jews all were burning with
				jealousy at the Prophet's triumphs which followed one
				after the other. The way they had been humbled within two
				years after Uhud, in the Battle of the Trench, and in the
				affair of the Quraizah, had made them sore at heart. They
				had also lost hope that they could ever subdue him on the
				battlefield. Therefore, they seized the question of this
				marriage as a godsend blessing for them and thought they
				would put an end to his moral superiority, which was the
				secret of his power and success. Therefore, stories were
				concocted that Muhammad, God forbid, had fallen in love
				with his daughter-in-law, and when his son had come to
				know of this, he divorced his wife, and the father
				married his daughter-in-law. The propaganda, however, was
				absurd on the face of it. Sayyidah Zainab was the
				Prophet's first cousin. He had known her from childhood
				to youth. So, there could be no question of his falling
				in love with her at first sight. Then he himself had
				arranged her marriage with Sayyiduna Zaid under his
				personal influence, although her whole family had opposed
				it. They did not like that a daughter of the noble
				Qureysh should be given in marriage to a freed slave.
				Sayyidah Zainab herself was not happy at this
				arrangement. But everyone had to submit to the Prophet's
				command. The marriage was solemnized and a precedent was
				set in Arabia that Islam had raised a freed slave to the
				status of the Qureyshite nobility. If the Prophet had in
				reality any desire for Sayyidah Zainab, there was no need
				in marrying her to Sayyiduna Zaid. He himself could have
				married her.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="The Laws of Hijab ">
			<p>
				The fact that the tales invented by the enemies of Islam
				also became topics of conversation among the Muslims, was
				a clear sign that the element of sensuality in society
				had crossed all limits. If this malady had not existed,
				it was not possible that people would have paid any
				attention whatever to such absurd stories about such a
				righteous and pure person like the Prophet. This was
				precisely the occasion when the reformative Commandments
				pertaining to the law of Hijab or Purdah were first
				introduced in the Islamic society. These reforms were

				This Surah deals with those objections of the
				disbelievers which they were raising against the
				Prophet's message of Tawhid and the Hereafter, and about
				his Prophethood, mostly in the form of allegations,
				taunts and mockery. These objections have been answered
				in the form of instructions, admonition and warning about
				the evil consequences of their stubbornness. The stories
				of the Sabians and the Prophets David and Solomon have
				been cited as to say: "You have both these historical
				precedents before you. On the one hand, there were the
				Prophets David and Solomon, who had been blessed by Allah
				with great powers and such grandeur and glory as had been
				granted to hardly any one of the like before them. In
				spite of this, they were not proud and arrogant, but
				remained grateful servants of their Rabb. On the other
				hand, were the people of Saba, who, when blessed by
				Allah, became proud, and were consequently so thoroughly
				destroyed and dispersed that they were remembered only in
				myths and legends. With these precedents in view, you may
				see and judge for yourselves as to which type of life is
				better: the one which is built on belief in Tawhid, the
				Hereafter and the attitude of gratefulness to Allah, or
				the one which is based on disbelief, shirk, denial of the
				Hereafter and the worship of materialism."

				This discourse warns and admonishes the people of Makkah
				and their chiefs for their antagonistic attitude towards
				the Prophet's message of Tawhid, as to say: "O foolish
				people, the way to which this Prophet is calling you is
				for your own benefit. Your anger, your tricks, your
				conspiracies and designs to frustrate the message or him
				are against your own benefit. If you do not listen to
				him, you will be harming your own selves, not him. Just
				consider and ponder over what he preaches:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					He repudiates shirk. If you look around
					carefully, you will yourself realize that there
					is no basis for shirk.
				</li>
				<li>
					He presents the Doctrine of Tawhid. If you use
					your common sense, you will come to the
					conclusion that there is no being beside Allah,
					the Creator of the Universe, which might possess
					divine attributes, powers and authority.
				</li>
				<li>
					He tells you that you have not been created to be
					irresponsible in this world and that you have to
					render an account of your deeds before your God.
				</li>
				<li>
					He tells you that there is life after the life of
					this world when everyone will meet the
					consequences of what he has done here. If you
					think, you will see that your doubts about it are
					absolutely baseless. Don't you see the phenomenon
					of creation and reproduction of day and night?
					How can then your own recreation be impossible
					for God Who created you from an insignificant
					sperm?
				</li>
				<li>
					Doesn't your own intellect testify that good and
					the evil cannot be alike? Think and judge for
					yourselves as to what is reasonable: should good
					and evil meet with same fate and end up as dust,
					or should good be rewarded and the evil be
					punished? 
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Now, if you do not admit and acknowledge these rational
				and reasonable arguments and do not abandon your false
				gods, the Prophet will not lose anything, rather, it is
				you who will suffer the consequences. The Prophet's
				responsibility is only to make the truth plain to you,
				which he has done."

				Imam Ahmed, Abu Daud, Nasai, Ibn Majah and Tabarani have
				related on the authority of Sayyiduna Ma'qil bin Yasar
				that the Prophet said: "Surah Ya-Sin is the heart of The
				Qur'an." This is similar to describing the Surah
				Al-Fatiha as the Umm-al-Qur'an (the essence or core of
				the Qur'an), because Al-Fatiha contains the sum and
				substance of the teaching of the whole Qur'an. Surah
				Ya-Sin has been called the throbbing heart of the Qur'an
				because it presents the message of the Qur'an in a most
				forceful manner which breaks the inertness and stirs the
				spirit of man to action. Imam Ahmed has also related that
				the Prophet said: "Recite Surah Ya-Sin to the dying ones
				among you." The objective is to refresh the dying
				person's memory about Islam and also bring before him a
				complete picture of the Hereafter so that he may know
				what stages he will have to pass after crossing the stage
				of this worldly life. In view of this, it would be
				desirable that, along with the recitation of the Surah Ya
				Sin, its translation is also read for the benefit of the

				The disbelievers of Makkah have been severely warned for

				courtyards of their houses. Brief and impressive
				arguments have been given about the validity of the

				The most instructive of historical narratives presented
				in this Surah is the importance of the pious life led by
				the Prophet Ibrahim, who became ready to sacrifice his
				only son as soon as he was asked by Allah to do so. In
				this, there was a lesson not only for the disbelieving
				Qureysh who were proud of their blood relationship with
				him, but also for the Muslims who had believed in Allah
				and His Messenger. By narrating this event they were told
				about the essence and the real spirit of Islam, and how a
				true believer should be ready to make sacrifices for the
				pleasure of Allah. The believers are given the good news
				that they should not be disheartened at the hardships and
				difficulties that they had to encounter in the beginning,
				for in the end, they will attain dominance. The bearers
				of falsehood, who appeared to be dominant at the time,
				would be overwhelmed and vanquished at the hands of the
				Muslims. A few years later, the turn of events proved
				that it was not an empty consolation but an inevitable
				reality of which the believers were foretold in order to
				strengthen their hearts.

				When Abu Talib fell ill, and the Qureysh chiefs knew that
				the end of his life was near, they held consultations and
				decided to approach the old chief with the request that
				he should solve the dispute between them and his nephew.
				They feared that if Abu Talib died and then they
				subjected Muhammad (pbuh) to harsh treatment after his
				death, the Arabs would taunt them, saying, "They were
				afraid of the old chief as long as he lived, now that he
				is dead, they have started mistreating his nephew." At
				least 25 of the Qureysh chiefs including Abu Jahl, Abu
				Sufyan and Umayyah bin Khalaf went to Abu Talib. First,
				they put before him their usual complaints against the
				Prophet as usual, then said, "We have come to present
				before you a just request and it is this : let your
				nephew leave us to our religion, and we shall leave him
				to his. He may worship whomever pleases: we shall not
				stand in his way in this matter; but he should not
				condemn our gods and should not try to force us to give
				them up. Please tell him to make terms with us on this
				condition". Abu Talib called the Prophet and said, "Dear
				nephew, these people of your tribe have come to me with a
				request. They want you to agree with them on a just
				matter so as to put an end to your dispute with them."
				Then he told him about the request of the chiefs of the
				Qureysh. The Prophet replied, "Dear uncle: I shall
				request them to agree upon a thing which, if they accept,
				will enable them to conquer the whole of Arabia and
				subject the non-Arab world to their domination. "Hearing
				this the people were first confounded; they did not know
				how they should turn down such a proposal. Then, after
				they had considered the matter, they replied: "You speak
				of one word: we are prepared to repeat ten others like
				it, but please tell us what it is." The Prophet said:
				La-Ilah-ill-Allah. At this they got up all together and
				left the place saying what Allah has narrated in the
				initial part of this Surah.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme">
			<p>
				The Surah begins with a review of the aforesaid meeting
				and the discourse is based on the dialogue between the
				Prophet and the disbelievers. Allah says that the actual
				reason for their denial is not because of any defect in
				the message of Islam, but their own arrogance, jealousy
				and insistence on following their ancestors blindly. They
				are not prepared to believe in a man from their own clan
				as a Prophet of God and follow him. After describing the
				stories of nine Prophets, one after the other, Allah has
				emphasized the point that His law of justice is impartial
				and that only the people of right attitude are acceptable
				to Him, that He calls to account and punishes every
				wrongdoer whoever he be, and likes only those people who
				do not persist in wrongdoing but repent as soon as they
				are informed about it, and pass their life in the world
				keeping in mind their accountability to Allah in the
				Hereafter.
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, mention has been made of the story of Adam
				and Iblees (Shaitan), which is meant to tell the
				disbelieving Qureysh that the same arrogance and vanity
				which was preventing them from bowing before Muhammad
				(pbuh) had prevented Iblees also from bowing before Adam.
				Iblees felt jealous of the high rank that Allah had given
				to Adam and was cursed when he disobeyed His Command.
				Likewise, "You, O people of Qureysh, are feeling jealous
				of the high rank that Allah has bestowed on Muhammad
				(pbuh) and are not prepared to obey him whereas Allah has
				appointed him as His Rasool. Therefore, you will be
				doomed ultimately to the same fate as that of Shaitan."

				mother tongue. Anyone could compose anything that he
				pleased in his mother tongue and then make the claim that
				he had received it from God. A miracle would be if the
				person would suddenly arise and make an eloquent speech
				in a foreign tongue which he did not know. Then only
				could one say that the discourse was not of his own
				composition, but a revelation from God."
			</p>
			<p>
				In response to this, this Surah has clearly stated: "This
				Qur'an is an unchangeable Book and you can not defeat it
				by your noise and falsehoods. Whether falsehood comes
				from the front or makes a secret and indirect attack from
				behind, it cannot succeed in refuting it. Now that the
				Qur'an is being presented in your own language so that
				you may understand it, you say that it should have been
				revealed in some foreign language. But had We sent it in
				a foreign language, you yourselves would have said: What
				a joke! The Arabs are being given guidance in a
				non-Arabic language, which nobody understands. In fact
				you have no desire to obtain guidance. You are only
				inventing new excuses for not affirming the faith. Have
				you ever considered that if this Qur'an is really from
				Allah, then what fate you would meet by denying and
				opposing it?"

				This Surah's period of revelation is not known from any
				authentic tradition, however, it appears from its subject
				matter that this Surah was sent down after Ha-M'im
				As-Sajdah / Fussilat, for it seems to be, in a way, a
				supplement to it. In Surah Ha-M'im As-Sajdah the Qureysh
				chiefs were taken to task for their deaf and blind
				opposition in order to show those who live in Makkah and
				in its outskirts and had any sense of morality and
				nobility left in them, how unreasonable those chiefs were
				in opposing Muhammad (pbuh). Yet, how serious he was in
				everything he said, how rational was his standpoint and
				how noble was his character and conduct? Immediately
				after that warning this Surah was sent down to provide
				teaching and instruction, and made the truth of the
				Prophet's message plain in such an impressive way that
				anyone who loves the truth could not help but to accept
				His message.

				This discourse, as depicted in Tafheem-ul-Qur'an, begins
				in a way as if to say: "Why are you expressing surprise
				and amazement at what Our Prophet is presenting before
				you? What he says is not new or strange, nor anything
				novel, which is being presented for the first time in
				history: that Revelation should come down to a man from
				God and he should be given instructions for the guidance
				of mankind. Allah has been sending similar Revelations
				with similar instructions to former Prophets. It is not
				surprising that the Owner of the Universe should be
				acknowledged as the Deity and Ruler, but what is strange
				is that one should accept another as divine and deity in
				spite of being His subject and slave. You are being angry
				with him who is presenting Tawhid before you, where as
				the shirk that you are practicing with regard to the
				Master of the Universe is such a grave crime as may cause
				the heavens to break asunder. The angels are amazed at
				this boldness of yours and fear that the wrath of Allah
				might descend on you any moment."
			</p>
			<p>
				After this, the people have been told that a person's
				being appointed to the Prophethood and his presenting
				himself as a Prophet does not mean that he has been made
				master of people's destinies and he has come to the world
				with that very claim. Allah has kept destiny in His own
				hands. The Prophet has come only to arouse the heedless
				and guide the strayed ones to the Right Path. To call to
				account those who do not listen to him and to punish or
				not to punish them is Allah's own responsibility and not
				a part of the Prophet's work. Therefore, they should take
				it out of their head that the Prophet has come with a
				claim similar to those that are made by their so called
				religious guides and saints to the effect that he who
				would not listen to them, or would behave insolently
				towards them, would be burnt to death: In this very
				connection, the people have also been told that the
				Prophet has not come to condemn them but he is their well
				wisher; he is warning them that the way they are
				following will only lead to their own destruction.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then an answer has been given to the question: Why didn't
				Allah make all human beings righteous by birth, and why
				did He allow the difference of viewpoint owing to which
				people start following each other in thought and action?
				After this, it has been explained that the way of life
				presented by the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) is that Allah
				Almighty is the Creator, Master and real Patron of the
				Universe and Man. He Alone is Man's Ruler, He Alone has
				the right to give Man Faith (Din) and Law (system of
				belief and practice) and judge the disputes of man and
				tell what is Truth and what is falsehood. No other being
				has any right whatever to be man's lawgiver. In other
				words, like natural sovereignty, the sovereignty with
				regard to lawmaking also is vested only in Allah. No man
				or creature, apart from Allah, can be the bearer of this
				sovereignty. And if a person does not recognize and
				accept this Divine rule of Allah, it is merely futile for
				him to recognize the natural sovereignty of Allah.
			</p>
			<p>
				On this very basis has Allah ordained a Din (True
				Religion) for Man from the very beginning. It was one and
				the same Religion that was vouchsafed in every age to all
				the Prophets. No Prophet ever founded any separate
				religion of his own. The same one Religion has been
				enjoined by Allah for all Mankind since the beginning of
				creation, and all the Prophets have been following it and
				inviting others to follow it.
			</p>
			<p>
				This Religion and Creed was not sent so that man may rest
				contentedly only with believing in it, but it was sent
				with the purpose and intention that it alone should be
				introduced, established and enforced in the world, and no
				man made religion should prevail in Allah's earth apart
				from His Religion. The Prophets had not been appointed
				only to preach this Religion, but to establish it in the
				world.
			</p>
			<p>
				This same religion is the original religion of mankind,
				but after the death of the Prophets, selfish people
				created new creeds by creating schisms for vested
				interests due to self-conceit, vanity and ostentation.
				All the different religions and creeds found in the world
				today have resulted from corruption of the original
				Divine Truth.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, the Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace,)
				has been assigned to present before the people the same
				and original Religion in place of the various practices
				and artificial creeds and man made religion, and may try
				to establish the same. Of this, if instead of being
				grateful, you feel angry and come out to fight him, it is
				your folly; the Prophet will not abandon his mission only
				because of your foolishness. He has been enjoined to
				adhere to his faith at all costs and to carry out the
				mission to which he has been appointed. Therefore, the
				people should not cherish any false hope that in order to
				please you he would cater to the same whims and
				superstitions of ignorance which has corrupted Allah's
				Religion before.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					That the Prophet was wholly unaware of this
					concept of the "Book" or the True Faith during
					the first forty years of his life and then his
					sudden appearance before the people with those
					two things, is a manifest proof of his being a
					Prophet.
				</li>
				<li>
					His presenting his own teaching as the teaching
					of God does not mean that he claims to have
					spoken to God, face to face, but God has conveyed
					to him this Guidance, as in the case of all other
					Prophets, in three ways: He speaks to His
					Prophets either through Revelation, or from
					behind a veil, or He sends an angel with the
					message. This thing was clarified so that the
					opponents of the message did not have an
					opportunity of accusing the Prophet of claiming
					to have spoken to God, face to face, and the
					lovers of the truth should know by what methods
					Allah gave instruction to the man whom He had
					appointed to the mission of Prophethood.

			<p>
				In this Surah, a forceful criticism has been made of the
				Qureysh and other Arab's creeds and superstitions of
				ignorance. The disbelievers were admitting the fact that
				the Creator of the earth, the heavens, themselves and
				their deities is only Allah. They also knew and admitted
				that the blessings they were benefiting from, had been
				bestowed by Allah; yet they insisted on making others
				associates of Allah in His Godhead. They believed that
				the angels were goddesses; they had carved their images
				as females; they adorned them with female dresses and
				ornaments, and called them daughters of Allah: they
				worshipped them and invoked them for the fulfillment of
				their needs. They had no answer to the question as to how
				do they knew that the angels were female? When they could
				not find the basis for their claims and superstitions,
				they presented the pretence of destiny and said: "Had
				Allah disapproved our these practices, we could not have
				worshipped these deities." Whereas the means of finding
				out whether Allah had approved of something or not, are
				His Books and not those things which are happening in the
				world according to His Will. For under His Will not only
				idol worship but crimes like theft, adultery, robbery,
				murder, etc. also are being committed. Can this argument
				be used to justify crime and evil in the world?
			</p>
			<p>
				When they were asked: "Have you any other authority,
				apart from this wrong argument, for the polytheism of
				yours?" They replied: "The same has been the practice
				since the time of our forefathers." In other words this,
				in their opinion, was a strong enough argument for a
				creed's being right and true, whereas the Prophet
				Ibrahim, being the descent of whom was the only basis of
				their pride and distinction, had rejected the religion of
				his elders left his home, and had discarded every such
				blind imitation of his forefathers which did not have the
				support of any rational argument.
			</p>
			<p>
				After criticizing each practice of ignorance of the
				disbelievers and rejecting it with rational arguments,
				this discourse has pointed out: " Allah has neither any
				offspring, nor are there separate gods for the earth or
				heavens, nor is there any intercessor who may be able to
				protect the disbelievers from Allah's punishment. Allah
				is far above from having a child. He Alone is the God of
				the whole universe: all others are His servants."

				This Surah's period of revelation could not be determined
				from any authentic tradition, but the internal evidence
				of the subject matter shows that this Surah was sent down
				in the same period in which Surah Zukhruf which is the
				middle stage of the Prophet's residence at Makkah when
				the whole land was overtaken by such a terrible famine
				that the people were sorely distressed. At last some of
				the Qureysh chiefs, including Abdullah bin Mas'ud and Abu

				This Surah was revealed for the admonition and warning of
				the people of Makkah stating: "The Hour when Allah, out
				of sheer mercy, decided to appoint a Rasool and send His
				Book to you was highly blessed. The fact is that a Rasool
				has been raised and the Book sent down in that particular
				Hour when Allah decides their destinies, and Allah's
				decisions are not weak that they may be changed to the
				people's liking. The only argument that you have given to
				practice shirk is that it had been the practice of you
				forefathers which is not any justification for such a
				heinous sin. If your forefathers had committed this
				folly, there is no reason for you to continue committing
				it blindly." 
			</p>
			<p>
				After this, the question of the famine, which was raging
				in Makkah at that time, is discussed. On the one hand,
				the Prophet is foretold that the people have not learned
				any lesson from this calamity, and on the other, the
				disbelievers are addressed so as to say : "You are lying
				when you say that you will believe as soon as the torment
				is removed from you. We shall remove it to see how
				sincere you are in your promise." In this connection,
				reference of Fir'on (Pharaoh) and his people is made that
				those people also met with the same trial, but after
				witnessing one sign after the other, they did not give up
				their stubbornness till at last they met their doom.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then the theme of the Hereafter is stated which the
				disbelievers had denied saying: "We have never seen
				anyone rising back to life after death. Raise our
				forefathers back to life if you are true in your claim
				about the life hereafter." The response to this is
				provided in these words: "This cannot be done to meet the
				demand of individuals; Allah has appointed a time when He
				will resurrect all mankind simultaneously and will
				subject them to accountability in His Court. If one has
				to protect oneself there, one should think about it here.
				For no one will be able to save himself there by his own
				power, nor by the power of any one else."
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, a warning is given: "This Qur'an has been
				revealed in simple language in your own tongue so that
				you may understand it; yet if you do not understand it
				and insist on seeing your evil end, you may wait; Our
				Prophet too is waiting. Whatever is to happen, will
				happen at Allah's appointed time."

			</p>
			<p>
				This discourse begins with the arguments for Tawhid. In
				this connection, reference has been made to the countless
				signs that are found in the world, from man's own body,
				to the earth and heavens, and it is pointed out that
				everywhere around him, man finds things which testify to

				carefully the variety of animals, the day and night, the
				rainfall and the vegetation thereby, the winds and his
				own creation, and ponders over them intelligently. He
				will find these Signs sufficiently convincing of the
				truth that this universe is not Godless, nor under the
				control of many gods, but it has been created by One God,
				called Allah, and He Alone is its Controller and Ruler.
				The countless forces and agencies that are serving his
				interests in the universe did not come into being just
				accidentally, nor have they been provided by gods and
				goddesses, but it is One God Alone Who has supplied and
				subjected these to him from Himself. If only a person
				uses his mind properly and rightly, his own intellect
				will proclaim that God Alone is man's real Benefactor and
				He Alone deserves that man should pay obedience to Him.
			</p>
			<p>
				About the hereafter Allah says: "It is utterly against
				reason and justice that the good and the bad, the
				obedient and the disobedient, the oppressor and the
				oppressed, should be made equal ultimately. Just as you
				did not become living of your own accord, but became
				living by Our power, so you do not die of your own
				accord, but die when We send death on you. And a time is
				certainly coming when you will all be gathered together.
				You may not believe in this because of your ignorance
				today, but the time will come when you will see it
				yourself. You will be presented before Allah and your
				whole book of conduct will be laid open bearing evidence
				against each of your misdeeds. Then you will come to know

		<section heading="History">
			<p>
				The 10th year of the Prophethood was a year of extreme
				persecution and distress in the prophet's life. The
				Qureysh and the other tribes had continued their boycott
				of the Bani Hashim and the Muslims for three years and
				the Prophet and the people of his family and companions
				lay besieged in Shi'b Abi Talib. The Qureysh had blocked
				up this area from all sides so that no supplies of any
				kind could reach the besieged people. Only during the
				Hajj season were they allowed to come out and purchase
				some articles of necessity. But even at that time,
				whenever Abu Lahab noticed any of them approaching the
				marketplace or a trading caravan he would call out to the
				merchants exhorting them to announce forbidding rates of
				their articles for them, and would pledge that he himself
				would buy those articles so that they did not suffer any
				loss. This boycott which continued uninterrupted for
				three years had broken the backs of the Muslims and the
				Bani Hashim; so much so that at times, they were forced
				to eat grass and the leaves of trees. At last, when the
				siege was lifted, Abu Talib, the Prophet's uncle, who had
				been shielding him for ten long years, died. Hardly a
				month later his wife, Sayyidah Khadijah, who had been a
				source of peace and consolation for him ever since the
				beginning of the call, also passed away. Because of these
				tragic incidents which closely followed each other, the
				Prophet used to refer to this year as the year of sorrow
				and grief.
			</p>
			<p>
				After the death of Sayyidah Khadijah and Abu Talib, the
				disbelievers of Makkah became even bolder in their
				campaign against the Prophet. The Prophet decided to go
				to Ta'if and approach the chiefs and nobles of the Bani
				Thaqif. But, not only did they refused to listen to him,
				they asked him to leave. When he was leaving, the chiefs
				of Thaqif sent their slaves and scoundrels after him.
				They screamed at him, abused him and pelted him with
				stones for most of the way from both sides of the road
				until he broke down, wounded bleeding. The degree of his
				injuries were such that his shoes were filled with blood.
				Wearied and exhausted, he took shelter in the shade of a
				wall of a garden outside Ta'if, and prayed:
			</p>
			<p>
				"O Allah, to You I complain of my weakness, little
				resource, and lowliness before men. O Most Merciful, You
				are the Rabb of the weak, and You are my Rabb. To whom
				will You confide me? To the one who will misuse me, or to
				an enemy to whom You have given power over me? If You are
				not angry with me, I care not. Your favor is wide for me.
				I take refuge in the light of Your countenance by which
				the darkness is illuminated, and the things of this world
				and the next are rightly ordered, lest Your anger
				descends upon me or Your wrath lights upon me. It is for
				You to be satisfied until You are well pleased. There is
				no power and no might except Yours." (Ibn Hisham: A.
				Guillaume's Translation, p. 193).
			</p>
			<p>
				Grief stricken and heart broken when he returned near
				Qarn al-Manazil, he felt as though the sky was overcast
				by clouds. He looked up and saw Gabriel in front of him,
				who called out: "Allah has heard the way your people have
				responded. He has, therefore, sent this angel in-charge
				of the mountains. You may command him as you please."
				Then the angel of the mountains greeted him and
				submitted:" If you like, I will overturn the mountains
				from either side upon these people." The Holy Prophet
				replied : "No, but I expect that Allah will create from
				their seed those who will worship none but Allah, the
				One." (Bukhari, Dhikr al Mala'ikah; Muslim: Kitab
				al-Maghazi; Nasa'i :Al-Bauth). One night when he was
				reciting the Qur'an in Prayer, a group of the jinn
				happened to pass by and listened to the Qur'an, believed
				in it, and returned to their people to preach Islam.
				Thus, Allah gave His Prophet the good news that, if
				people were running away from his invitation, there were
				many jinn, who had become believers, and they were
				spreading the message among their own kind. Anyone who
				keeps this background in view, and studies this Surah
				will have no doubt left in his mind that this is not at
				all the composition of Muhammad (pbuh), but "a Revelation
				from the All Mighty, All Wise Allah." For nowhere in this

				The theme of this Surah is to prepare the believers for
				war through providing them instructions to that effect.
				This is why this Surah is also called Al-Qital. The two
				groups were confronting each other at that time, one
				which had refused to accept the Truth (disbelievers) and
				the other group which had accepted the Truth (believers)
				which had been sent down by Allah to His servant,
				Muhammad (pbuh). Allah in His final decision, has
				rendered fruitless and vain all the works of the
				disbelievers and set right the condition and affairs of
				the believers.
			</p>
			<p>
				The believers (Muslims) have been given instructions
				relating to war and are reassured of Allah's help and
				guidance. They are given hope for the best rewards on
				offering sacrifices and struggle in the cause of Allah,
				both in this world and in the hereafter. Then the
				discourse turns towards the hypocrites, who were claiming
				to be sincere Muslims before the command to fight. They
				were confounded after this command. They began to
				conspire with the disbelievers in order to save
				themselves from the hazards of war. They are plainly
				warned that the acts and deeds of the hypocrites are not
				acceptable to Allah 
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, the Muslims are invited to spend their
				wealth in the cause of Allah, although at that time, they
				were economically very weak. They are clearly warned that
				anyone who adopts a miserly attitude would not harm Allah
				but would result in his own destruction, for Allah does
				not stand in need of help from men. If one group of men
				shirk from offering sacrifices in the cause of Allah, He
				would remove it and bring another group in its place.

				This Surah should be read keeping in mind the following
				historical background. In A.H. 6, the Prophet saw a dream
				that he went to Makkah with his Companions and had
				performed Umrah. Obviously, the Prophet's dream could not
				be a mere dream and fiction for it is a kind of Divine
				inspiration as Allah Himself has confirmed in verse 27.
				Where He said that He Himself had shown that dream to His
				Rasool. It was not merely a dream but a Divine
				inspiration which the Prophet had to obey and follow.
				Therefore, the Prophet informed his Companions of his
				dream and began to make preparations for the journey.
				Among the tribes living in the suburbs he had the public
				announcement made that he was proceeding for Umrah and
				the people could join him. About 1,400 of the Companions
				joined him on this highly dangerous journey.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="History">
			<p>
				They set off from Madinah in the beginning of Dhil
				Q'adah, A. H. 6. At Dhul Hulaifah they put on pilgrims
				robes with the intention of performing Umrah, took 70
				camels with collars round their necks indicating that
				they were sacrificial animals; and kept only a sword each
				in sheaths, which the pilgrims to the Ka'bah were allowed
				to carry according to the recognized custom of Arabia.
				They carried no other weapons. Thus, the caravan set out
				for the Ka'bah, the House of Allah, in Makkah, chanting
				the prescribed slogan of "Labbaik, Allahumma labbaik."
			</p>
			<p>
				The Holy Prophet despatched a man of the Bani Ka'b as a
				secret agent so that he may keep him informed of the
				intentions and movements of the Qureysh. When the Prophet
				reached Usfan, he brought the news that the Qureysh had
				reached Dhi Tuwa with full preparations and they had sent
				Khalid bin Walid with two hundred cavalry towards
				Kura'al-Ghamim to intercept him. The Qureysh wanted
				somehow to provoke the Prophet's companions to fight so
				that they could tell the Arabs that the Muslims had
				actually come to fight and had put on the pilgrim
				garments only to deceive others. Upon receiving this
				information, the Prophet immediately changed his route
				and following a very rugged, rocky track, reached
				Hudeybiyah, which was situated right on the boundary of
				the sacred Makkan territory. Here, he was visited by
				Budail bin Warqa, the chief of the Bani Khuza'ah along
				with some men of his tribe. They asked what he had come
				for. The Prophet replied that he and his companions had
				come only for pilgrimage to the House of Allah. The men
				of Khuza'ah went and told this to the Qureysh chiefs and
				counselled them not to interfere with the pilgrims.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Qureysh sent Urwah bin Mas'ud Thaqafi who held
				lengthy negotiations with the Prophet and persuaded him
				to give up his intention to enter Makkah. But the Prophet
				gave him the same reply that he had given to the chief of
				the Khuza'ah. Urwah went back and said to the Qureysh: "I
				have been to the courts of the Caesar, the Khosroes and
				the Negus but, by God, never have I seen any people so
				devoted to a king as are the companions of Muhammad. If
				Muhammad makes his ablutions they would not let the water
				fall thereof on the ground but would rub it on their
				bodies and clothes. Now you may decide as to what you
				should do."
			</p>
			<p>
				The Prophet sent Sayyiduna Uthman (may Allah be pleased
				with him) as his envoy to Makkah with the message that
				they had come only for pilgrimage and had brought their
				sacrificial camels along, and that they would go back
				after performing the rite of pilgrimage and offering
				sacrifice. But the Qureysh did not agree and withheld
				Sayyiduna Uthman in the city. In the meantime a rumor
				spread that Sayyiduna Uthman had been killed. Since he
				did not return in time, the Muslims took the rumor to be
				true. Now they could show no more forbearance because
				their ambassador was put to death. The Muslims had no
				alternative but to prepare for war. Therefore, the
				Prophet summoned all his companions and took a solemn
				pledge from them that they would fight to death. It was
				not an ordinary undertaking. The Muslims were only 1400
				and had come without any weapons. They were camping at
				the boundary of Makkah, which was 250 miles away from
				their own city. The enemy could attack them in full
				strength and could surround them with its allies from the
				adjoining tribes as well. In spite of this, none from the
				caravan except, one man, failed to give his pledge to
				fight to death, and there could be no greater proof of
				their dedication and sincerity to the cause of Allah.
				This pledge is well known in the history of Islam and is
				called the Bait-e-Ridwan.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Terms of Treaty">
			<p>
				Later on they came to know that the news about Sayyiduna
				Uthman was false. He return with a deputation under the
				leadership of Suhail bin 'Amr from the Qureysh to
				negotiate peace with the Prophet. The Qureysh insisted no
				more in disallowing the Prophet and his companions to
				enter Makkah. However, in order to save face, they
				insisted only that they should return that year and come
				back the following year to perform Umrah. After lengthy
				negotiations, peace was concluded on the following terms:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					War would be suspended for ten years, and no
					party would engage in any hostility, open or
					secret, against the other.
				</li>
				<li>
					If anyone during that period from among the
					Qureysh defected to Muhammad's camp, without his
					guardian's permission, he would be returned back
					to Makkah. But, if a companion of Muhammad were
					to defect to the Qureysh, there will be no
					requirement for his return.
				</li>
				<li>
					Every Arab tribe would have the option to join
					either side as its ally and enter the treaty.
				</li>
				<li>
					Muhammad and his men would go back that year and
					could come the following year for Umrah and stay
					in Makkah for three days, provided that they
					brought only one sheathed sword each, and no
					other weapon of war. In those three days, the
					Makkans would vacate the city for them (so that
					there was no chance of conflict), but they would
					not be allowed to take along any Makkan on
					return.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</section>
		<section heading="Reaction to the Treaty">
			<p>
				The disbelieving Qureysh looked at this treaty as a
				victory and the Muslims were upset considering this as a
				humiliation in accepting these conditions. When the
				document was finished, the Prophet asked his companions
				to slaughter their sacrificial animals at that very
				place, shave their heads and put off the pilgrim
				garments, but no one moved. The Prophet repeated the
				order thrice but the companions were so much in shock,
				depression and dejection that they did not comply. During
				his entire period of Risalat (Prophethood) on no occasion
				had it ever happened that he (Prophet Muhammad) command
				his companions to do something and they did not hasten to
				comply. This caused him a great shock. Returning to his
				tent he expressed his grief to his wife, Sayyidah Umme
				Salamah. She said, "You shall quietly go and slaughter
				your own camel and call the barber to have your head
				shaved. After that, the people will automatically do what
				you did and will understand that whatever decision you
				have taken will not be changed." That is what precisely
				happened. The people slaughtered their animals, shaved
				their heads or cut their hair short and put off the
				pilgrim garb. Nevertheless their hearts were still
				afflicted with grief.
			</p>
			<p>
				Later, when this caravan was returning to Madinah, this
				Surah was revealed, telling the Muslims that the treaty
				that they were regarding as their defeat was in fact a
				great victory. The Holy Prophet summoned the Muslims
				together and said: "Today such a thing has been sent down
				to me which is more valuable to me than the world and
				what it contains." Then recited this Surah. The believers
				became satisfied when they heard this Divine Revelation.
				The advantages of this treaty began to appear one after
				the other which proved that this peace treaty indeed was
				a great victory. Salient features of this treaty were as
				follows:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					This treaty acknowledged the existence of the
					Islamic State in Arabia. Prior to this, the Arabs
					considered the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) and his
					Companions as rebels and outlaws. By concluding
					this agreement, the Qureysh themselves recognized
					the Prophet's sovereignty over the territories of
					the Islamic State and opened the way for the Arab
					tribes to enter into treaties of alliance with
					either one of the powers.
				</li>
				<li>
					The Qureysh acknowledged the Muslim's right of
					pilgrimage to the House of Allah. They admitted
					that Islam was not an antireligious creed, and
					like the other Arabs, its followers also had the
					right to perform the rites of Hajj and Umrah.
					This diminished the hatred in the Arab's hearts
					caused by the propaganda made by the Qureysh
					against Islam and its followers.
				</li>
				<li>
					The no-war pact for ten years provided full peace
					to the Muslims, and they were able to preach
					Islam in such a way that within two years after
					Hudeybiyah, the number of the people who embraced
					Islam far exceeded those of the past 19 years. It
					was due to this treaty that two years later, when
					in consequence of the Qureysh's violating the
					treaty, the Prophet invaded Makkah. He was
					accompanied by an army 10,000 strong, whereas on
					the occasion of Hudeybiyah, only 1,400 men had
					joined him in the march.
				</li>
				<li>
					The suspension of hostilities provided the
					Prophet an opportunity to establish and
					strengthen Islamic rule and turn the Islamic
					society into a full-fledged civilization and way
					of life through practicing the Islamic law. This
					is that great blessing about which Allah says in
					verse 3 of Surah Al-Ma'idah: "Today I have
					perfected your Religion for you and completed My
					blessing on you and approved Islam as the Way of
					Life for you."
				</li>
				<li>
					The balance of power in Arabia changed within two
					years after this treaty was signed and the
					strength of the Qureysh and other pagan tribes
					diminished and the domination of Islam became
					certain. One provision of this treaty which had
					disturbed the Muslims most was the condition
					about the fugitives from Makkah and Madinah, that
					the former would be returned and the latter would
					not be returned. But not much longer afterwards
					this condition also proved to be disadvantageous
					for the Qureysh. The experience revealed what
					far-reaching consequences the Prophet had
					foreseen and why he accepted it. A few days after
					the treaty a Muslim of Makkah, Abu Basir, escaped
					from the Qureysh and reached Madinah. The Qureysh
					demanded him back and the Prophet returned him to
					their men who had been sent from Makkah to arrest
					him. But while on the way to Makkah, he again
					fled and sat on the road by the Red Sea shore,
					which the trade caravans of the Qureysh took to
					Syria. After that, every Muslim who succeeded in
					escaping from the Qureysh would go and join Abu
					Basir instead of going to Madinah, until 70 men
					gathered there. They would attack any Qureysh
					caravan that passed that way cutting it to
					pieces. At last, the Qureysh themselves begged
					the Prophet to call those men to Madinah, and the
					condition relating to the return of the fugitives
					itself became null and void.
				</li>
				<li>
					Being assured of peace from the south, the
					Muslims overpowered all the opposing forces in
					the north and central Arabia easily. Just three
					months after Hudeybiyah, Khayber, the major
					stronghold of the Jews, was conquered and after
					it the Jewish settlements of Fadak, Wad-il-Qura,
					Taima and Tabuk also fell to the Muslims one
					after the other. Then, all other tribes of
					central Arabia which were bound in alliance with
					the Jews and Qureysh, came under the sway of
					Islam.

				The subject matter of this Surah is to teach Muslims

				verses they are taught the manners they should observe
				with regard to Allah and His Rasool. They are given the
				instruction that it is not right to believe information
				without basis and not to act without careful thought. If
				information is received about a person, a group or a
				community, it should be evaluated carefully to see
				whether the source of information is reliable or not. If
				the source is not reliable, it should be tested and
				examined to see whether the news is authentic or not
				before taking any action on it. Guidance is provided
				towards attitudes that Muslims should adopt in cases
				where groups of Muslims have conflict with each other.
			</p>
			<p>
				Muslims are exhorted to safeguard against the evils that
				corrupt collective life and spoil mutual relationships
				such as mocking and taunting each other, calling other
				names, creating suspicions, spying into other people's
				affairs and backbiting. All of these evils are declared
				as forbidden and unlawful. In addition, national and
				racial distinctions that cause universal corruption in
				the world are condemned. Nations, tribes and families'
				pride of ancestry tend to look down upon others as
				inferior to themselves. Nationalism historically promotes
				superiority complexes that have been the main cause of
				injustices, wars and tyranny in the world. In this Surah
				Allah has cut the root of this evil by stating that all
				men are descendants of the same pair of humans (Adam
				&amp;

			<p>
				In conclusion, people are told that true Faith is not the
				verbal statement of believing in Allah and His Rasool,
				but to obey them in practical life and to exert sincere
				efforts with one's self and wealth in the cause of Allah.
				As for those who profess Islam orally without testifying
				by their hearts and actions, thinking that they had done
				someone a favor by accepting Islam; they may be counted

				Authentic traditions show that the Prophet used to recite
				this Surah generally in the Prayer on the Eid days. A
				woman named Umme Hisham bin Harithah, who was a neighbor
				of the Prophet, said that she was able to commit Surah
				Qaf to memory only because she often heard it from the
				Prophet in the Friday sermons. According to some other
				traditions, he often recited during Fajr Prayer. This
				makes it abundantly clear that this was an important
				Surah in the sight of the Prophet. That is why he made
				sure that its contents reached as many people as possible
				over and over again.
			</p>
			<p>
				The reason for its importance can be easily understood by
				careful study of the Surah. The theme of the entire Surah
				is the Hereafter. When the Prophet started preaching his
				message in Makkah, what surprised the people most was the
				news that people would be resurrected after death, and
				they would have to render an account of their deeds. In
				this Surah, arguments are given for the possibility and
				occurrence of the hereafter in a brief way, in short
				sentences, and the people are warned, as if to say:
				"Whether you express wonder and surprise, or you regard
				it as something remote from reason, or deny it
				altogether, in any case it cannot change the truth. The
				absolute, unalterable truth is that Allah knows the
				whereabouts of each and every particle of your body that
				has decomposed in the earth, and knows where and in what
				state it is. Allah's one signal is enough to make all the
				decomposed particles gather together again and to make
				you rise up once again as you had been created in your
				earthly life. Likewise, the idea that you have been
				created alone in the world and that you are not
				answerable to anyone, is no more than a misunderstanding.
				The fact is that not only is Allah Himself directly aware
				of each act and word of yours; even of the ideas that
				pass in your mind, but His angels also are attached to
				each one of you and are recording whatever you do and
				utter. On the Day of Judgment you will come out of your
				graves at one call just as the young shoots of vegetable
				sprout up from the earth after the first rain shower.
				Then, this heedlessness which obstructs your vision will
				be removed and you will see with your own eyes all that
				you are denying today. At that time, you will realize
				that you have not been created to be irresponsible in
				this world but accountable for all your deeds and you
				will be awarded paradise as a reward or hell as a
				punishment. The paradise and the hell which you regard as
				impossible and imaginary things will, at that time,
				become visible realities. In consequence of your enmity
				and opposition to the truth, you will be cast into the
				same hell which you deny today and those who fear Allah
				and adopt the path of righteousness, will be admitted to
				the same paradise at the mention of which you express
				wonder and surprise.

				invitation to Tawhid. The people are warned that refusal
				to accept the message of the Prophets and persistence in
				ignorance proved to be disastrous for those nations who
				adopted this attitude in the past.
			</p>
			<p>
				People's different and conflicting beliefs about the end
				of human life are themselves an express proof that none
				of these beliefs and creeds is based on knowledge;
				everyone individually has formed an ideology on the basis
				of conjecture which has become his creed. Someone thought
				that there would be no life-after-death; someone believed
				in life- after-death, but in the form of the
				transmigration of souls; someone believed in the life
				hereafter and the meting out of reward and punishment,
				but invented different sorts of props and supports to
				escape retribution. About a question of such vital and
				fundamental importance, a wrong view of which renders
				man's whole life-work wasted ultimately ruining his
				future for ever, it would be a disastrous folly to build
				an ideology only on the basis of speculation and
				conjecture, and without knowledge. It would mean that man
				should remain involved in grave misunderstanding, his
				whole life passing in heedless, error, and after death,
				should suddenly meet with a situation for which he had
				made no preparation at all. There is only one way of
				forming the right opinion about such a question which is
				through the knowledge that the Prophet of Allah has
				conveyed.
			</p>
			<p>
				The invitation to Tawhid is given in the following words:
				"Your Creator has not created you for the service of
				others, but for His own service. He is not like your
				false gods which receive sustenance from you and the
				godhead of which cannot function without your help. He is
				the God, Who is the Sustainer of all, Who does not stand
				in need of sustenance from anyone and Whose Godhead is
				functioning by His own power and might. Finally, the
				Prophet is instructed to ignore the rebels and keep on
				performing his mission of invitation and admonition, for
				it is useful and beneficial for the believers, although
				it may not be so for the other people. As for the wicked
				people who still persist in their rebellion, they should
				know that their predecessors who followed the same way of
				life, have already received their shares of the
				punishment.

				Swearing an oath by some realities and signs which

				Then, the Qureysh chiefs' attitude towards the message of
				the Prophet (pbuh) is criticized. They called him a
				sorcerer, a madman, or a poet, and would thus mislead the
				common people against him so that they should not pay any
				serious attention to the message he preached. They looked
				upon him as a calamity that had suddenly descended on
				them and would openly wish to get rid of him. They
				accused him of fabricating the Qur'an by himself and of
				presenting it in the name of Allah and thus it was fraud
				that he was committing. They would often taunt him,
				saying that Allah could not have appointed an ordinary
				man like him to the office of Prophethood. They expressed
				great disgust at his invitation and message and would
				avoid him as if he was asking them a reward for it. They
				would sit and take counsels together to devise schemes in
				order to put an end to his mission. And while they did
				all this, they never realized what creeds of ignorance
				they were practicing and how selflessly and sincerely was
				Muhammad (pbuh) exerting himself to deliver them from
				their error. While criticizing them for this attitude and
				conduct, Allah has put before them certain questions, one
				after the other, each of which is either an answer to
				some objection of theirs, or a criticism of some error.
				Then, it has been said that it would absolutely be of no
				avail to show them a miracle in order to convince them of
				his Prophethood, for they were such stubborn people as
				would misinterpret anything they were shown only to avoid
				affirming the faith.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Holy Prophet (pbuh) is given the instruction that he
				should persistently continue giving his invitation and
				preaching his message in spite of the accusations and
				objections of his opponents and enemies, and should
				endure their resistance patiently till Allah's judgement
				comes to pass. Besides, he has been consoled, as if to
				say "Your Rabb has not left you alone to face your
				enemies, after raising you as a Prophet, but He is
				constantly watching over you. Therefore, endure every
				hardship patiently till the Hour of His Judgement comes,
				and seek through praising and glorifying your Rabb the
				power that is required for exerting in the cause of Allah
				under such conditions.

				This is the first Surah of the Qur'an, which the Prophet

				The theme of the discourse is to warn the disbelievers of
				Makkah about the error of the attitude that they had
				adopted towards the Qur'an and the Prophet Muhammad
				(pbuh). The discourse starts by saying: "Muhammad is
				neither deluded nor gone astray, as you are telling
				others in your propaganda against him, nor has he
				fabricated this teaching of Islam and its message, as you
				seem to think he has. In fact, whatever he is presenting
				is nothing but Revelation which is sent down to him. The
				verities that he presents before you, are not the product
				of his own surmise and speculation but realities of which
				he himself is an eye witness. He has himself seen the
				Angel through whom this knowledge is conveyed to him. He
				has been directly made to observe the great Signs of
				Allah during his trip of M'iraj; whatever he says is not
				what he has himself thought out but what he has seen with
				his own eyes." After this, following three convincing
				arguments are presented:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					The religion that you are following is based on
					mere conjecture and invented ideas. You have set
					up a few goddesses like Lat and Manat and Uzza,
					whereas they have no share in divinity. You
					regard the angels as the daughters of Allah. You
					think that these deities of yours can influence
					Allah in your favor, whereas the fact is that all
					the angels together, who are stationed closest to
					Allah, cannot influence Him even in their own
					favor. None of beliefs that you have adopted is
					based on knowledge and reason, but are wishes and
					desires for the sake of which you have taken some
					whims as realities. This is a grave error.
				</li>
				<li>
					The final judgement will not depend on what you
					consider yourself to be, and on the claims you
					make about your purity and chastity but on
					whether you are pious or impious, righteous or
					unrighteous in the sight of Allah. If you refrain
					from major sins, He in His mercy will overlook
					your minor errors.
				</li>
				<li>
					A few basic principles of the true faith are
					reiterated which were stated in the Books of the
					Prophets Abraham and Moses, so that there remains
					no misunderstanding that Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)
					has brought some new and novel religion. These
					are the same fundamental truths which the former
					Prophets of Allah have always been presenting in
					their respective ages. It is made clear that the
					destruction of the 'Ad, the Thamud and of the
					people of the Prophets Nuh (Noah) and Lut (Lot)
					was not the result of accidental calamities, but
					Allah has destroyed them in consequence of the
					same wickedness and rebellion from which the
					disbelievers of Makkah are not inclined to
					refrain and desist.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				This was such an impressive discourse, by it even the
				most hardened deniers of the truth were completely
				overwhelmed, and when after reciting these verses of
				Divine Word the Prophet of Allah (pbuh) fell down in
				prostration, they too could not help falling down in
				prostration along with him.

				In this Surah, the disbelievers of Makkah have been
				warned about their stubbornness towards the message of
				the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).
				The amazing and wonderful phenomenon of the splitting of
				the Moon was a manifest sign of the truth that the
				Resurrection, of which the Prophet was giving them the
				news, could take place. The great sphere of the Moon had
				split into two distinct parts in front of their very
				eyes. The two parts had separated and receded so much
				apart from each other that, to the onlookers, one part
				had appeared on one side of the mountain and the other on
				the other side of it. Then, in an instant, the two had
				rejoined. This was manifest proof of the truth that the
				system of the Universe was neither eternal nor immortal;
				it could be disrupted. The disbelievers described it as a
				magical illusion and persisted in their denial. Such
				people neither believe in the admonition, nor learn a
				lesson from history, nor affirm faith after witnessing
				manifest signs with their eyes. They would believe only
				when resurrection has taken place and they will be
				rushing out of their graves towards the Summoner on that
				Day. The stories of the people of Nuh (Noah) and of 'Ad
				and Thamud and of the peoples of Lut (lot) and the Fir'on
				(Pharaoh) have been related briefly and they have been
				reminded of the terrible punishments that these nations
				suffered when they belied and disregarded the warnings
				given by the Prophets of Allah.

				This is the only Surah of the Qur'an in which, besides
				men, the jinn are directly addressed. In this Surah both
				men and jinn are taught to realize the wonders of Allah's
				power, His countless blessings, their own helplessness
				and accountability before Him. They are warned of the
				evil consequences of being disobedient to Him and made
				aware of the best results of His obedience.
			</p>
			<p>
				Although at several other places in the Qur'an there are
				clear pointers that the jinn are a creation, who like
				men, are endowed with freedom of will and action and are
				therefore, accountable; who have been granted the freedom
				of belief and unbelief and of obedience and disobedience.
				Also among them are believers and unbelievers, the
				obedient and the rebellious, just as there are among
				human beings. Also among them exists such groups as have
				believed in the Prophets sent by God and in the Divine
				Books. This Surah clearly points out that the message of
				the Prophet (pbuh) and the Qur'an is meant both for men
				and for jinn. His Prophethood is not restricted to human
				beings alone. The beginning of the Surah addresses human
				beings. But from verse 13 onward both men and jinn are

				The theme of this Surah is the hereafter, Tawhid and

				Qur'an. In regards to Tawhid and the hereafter convincing
				arguments are given and man's attention is drawn to his
				own body, the food that he eats, the water that he drinks
				and the fire on which he cooks his food. He is invited to
				ponder the question, "What right do you have to behave
				independently or serve any other deity than God (Allah),
				Whose creative power has brought you into being and Whose
				provisions sustain you. How can you entertain the idea

				In conclusion, man is warned that he may shut his eyes to
				the truth in his arrogance, but death is enough to open
				his eyes. At death he becomes helpless: he cannot save
				his own parents; he cannot save his own children; he
				cannot save his religious guides and beloved leaders.
				They all die in front of his vary eyes while he looks on
				helplessly. If there is no supreme power ruling over him,
				and his assumption is correct that he is all in all in
				the world, and there is no God (Allah), then why can't he
				restore to the dying person his soul? Just as he is
				helpless in this, so it is also beyond his power to stop
				Allah from calling the people to account and granting
				them rewards or punishment. He may or may not believe it,
				but every dying person will surely see his own end after
				death.

				This Surah persuades the Muslims to make monetary
				sacrifices in particular, and to make them realize that
				Islam did not merely consist in verbal affirmation and
				some outward practices, but its essence and spirit is
				sincerity towards Allah and His Religion. The faith of
				the one who was devoid of this spirit and who regarded
				his own self and wealth as dearer to himself than Allah
				and His Religion, was hollow and has no value in the
				sight of Allah. The attributes of Allah Almighty are
				mentioned in order to make the listeners realize as to
				Who is addressing them. Then, the following guidance is
				given:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					The inevitable demand of the Faith is that one
					should not shirk spending one's wealth for the
					sake of Allah. In fact the wealth belongs to
					Allah, and man has been granted proprietary
					rights only as His vicegerent. Yesterday this
					wealth was in other people's possession, today it
					is with you, and tomorrow it will pass onto
					someone else. Ultimately, it will go back to
					Allah, Who is the inheritor of everything in the
					universe. Only a portion of this wealth will be
					of any use to man, which he spends in the Cause
					of Allah during the period it is in his
					possession.
				</li>
				<li>
					Although making sacrifices for the Sake of Allah
					is commendable in all cases, the true worth of
					these sacrifices is determined by the nature of
					the occasion. There is an occasion when the power
					of paganism is overwhelming and there is a danger
					that it might subdue and overcome Islam
					completely; there is another occasion when Islam
					is in a stronger position in its struggle against
					paganism and the believers are attaining
					victories. Both these states are not equal as
					regards their respective importance. Therefore,
					the sacrifices that are made in these different
					states would also not be equal. Those who
					sacrifice their lives and expend their wealth to
					further promote the Cause of Islam when it is
					already strong cannot attain to the rank of those
					who struggled with their lives and their wealth
					to promote and uphold the cause of Islam when it
					was weak.
				</li>
				<li>
					Whatever is spent for the Cause of Islam is a
					loan to Allah. Allah will not only return it
					manifold, but will also give from Himself an
					extra reward.
				</li>
				<li>
					In the Hereafter, the Light shall be bestowed
					only on those believers who spent their wealth in
					the Cause of Allah. As for the hypocrites who
					watched and served only their own interests in
					the world, and who were least bothered whether
					the Truth or falsehood prevailed, they will be
					segregated from the believers in the Hereafter.
					Not only will they be deprived of the Light, but
					will be counted among the disbelievers.
				</li>
				<li>
					The life of this world is like a crop which
					flourishes and blooms, then turns pale and then
					finally is reduced to chaff. The everlasting life
					is the life Hereafter when results of great
					consequence will be announced. Therefore, if one
					has to envy for something, it should be for
					Paradise.
				</li>
				<li>
					Whatever good a man gets and whatever hardship he
					suffers in the world, is preordained by Allah. A
					true believer is he who does not lose heart in
					affliction and is not puffed up with pride in
					good times. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Allah sent His Messengers with clear signs and
					the Book and the Law of Justice so that the
					people may conduct their affairs in justice, and
					He sent down iron so that power may be used to
					establish the Truth and vanquish falsehood.

				In this Surah, instructions have been given to the

				at that time. From the beginning of the Surah to verse 6,
				legal injunctions about Zihar are given. The Muslims are
				strictly warned that they should not persist in the
				practices of ignorance after they have accepted Islam.
			</p>
			<p>
				In vv. 7-10 the hypocrites are taken to task for their
				secret consultations by which they conspired against the
				Prophet (pbuh) and, because of their hidden malice and
				grudge, they used to greet him, like the Jews, in a
				manner as to wish him ill instead of well. In this
				connection the Muslims are consoled: "These secret
				consultations of the hypocrites can do no harm to you;
				therefore, you should go on doing your duty with full
				trust in Allah". Besides, they are also taught: "The true
				believers, when they talk secretly together, do not talk
				of sin and transgression and disobedience to the
				Messenger. If they have to talk secretly together they
				should talk of goodness and piety."
			</p>
			<p>
				In vv. 11-13 the Muslims are taught manners of social
				behavior and given instructions to eradicate social evils
				which were prevalent among the people then as they are
				today. In the case of people sitting in an assembly, when
				more people arrive, they do not even show the courtesy to
				squeeze together to make room for others. The result
				being that the newcomers have to keep standing, sit in
				the doorway, to leave or seeing that there is still not
				enough room start jumping over the peoples' heads to find
				room for themselves. This often used to be experienced in
				the Prophet's assemblies. Therefore, Allah gave the
				instruction: "Do not behave selfishly and narrow-mindedly
				in your assemblies. Accommodate the newcomers also with
				an open heart."
			</p>
			<p>
				From verse 14 to the end of the Surah, members of the
				Muslim society - which was a mixture of the sincere
				Muslims, the hypocrites and the waverers - have been told
				plainly as to what is the criterion of sincerity in
				Islam:
			</p>
			<p>
				Some so called Muslims are those who befriend the enemies
				of Islam: they do not hesitate for the sake of their
				interests to be treacherous to the religion which they
				profess to believe in; they spread all sorts of doubts
				and suspicions against Islam and prevent the people from
				adopting the Way of Allah. But since they are part of the
				Muslim community their false profession of Faith serves
				them as a cover and shield.
			</p>
			<p>
				Other kind of Muslim are those who, in the matter of
				Allah's Religion, do not care even for their own father,
				brother, children and family, to say nothing of others.
				They do not cherish any feeling of love for the person
				who is an enemy of Allah, His Rasool and His Religion.
			</p>
			<p>
				In these verses, Allah explicitly states that the people
				of the first kind, in fact, belong to Satan's party
				however hard they may try to convince others of their
				Islam by swearing oaths. The honor of belonging to
				Allah's party is possessed only by the Muslims of the
				second kind. They alone are the true Muslims, they alone
				will attain to true success and with them alone is Allah
				well pleased.

				The theme of this Surah is an appraisal of the battle
				against the Bani An-Nadhir which can be summarized as
				follows:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					There is an admonition to take heed of the fate
					that had just befallen the Bani an-Nadhir. A
					major tribe which was as strong in numbers as the
					Muslims, whose people boasted of far more wealth
					and possessions, who were by no means ill
					equipped militarily and whose forts were well
					fortified but could not stand siege even for a
					few days. They expressed their readiness to
					accept banishment from their centuries old, well
					established settlement even though not a single
					man from among them was killed. Allah says that
					this happened not because of any power possessed
					by the Muslims but because the Jews had tried to
					resist and fight Allah and His Messenger. Those
					who dare to resist the power of Allah always meet
					with the same fate.
				</li>
				<li>
					An exception to the law relating to war is
					enunciated: "The destruction caused in the enemy
					territory for military purposes does not come
					under spreading mischief in the earth."
				</li>
				<li>
					Guidance is provided as to how the lands and
					properties which came under the control of the
					Islamic State as a result of war or peace terms,
					are to be managed. It was the first ever occasion
					that the Muslims took control of a conquered
					territory, the law concerning it was laid down
					for their guidance.
				</li>
				<li>
					The attitude of the hypocrites on the occasion of
					this battle is reviewed and the causes underlying
					it are pointed out.
				</li>
				<li>
					The last section is an admonition for all those
					people who had professed to have affirmed the
					faith and joined the Muslim community, but were
					devoid of the true spirit of the Faith. In it
					they have been told what the real demand of the
					Faith is, what the real difference between piety
					and wickedness is, what the place and importance
					of the Qur'an, which they professed to believe
					in, is and what the attributes of God, in Whom
					they claimed to have believed.

		<section heading="Historical Background of Jews in Madinah">
			<p>
				In order to understand the subject matter of this Surah,
				it is necessary to know the history of the Jews residing
				in Madinah and Hijaz, for without it, one cannot
				understand the real causes behind the way the Prophet's
				dealt with their different tribes.
			</p>
			<p>
				According to Abul A'la Maududi, no authentic history of
				the Arabian Jews exists in the world. They have not left
				any writings of their own in the form of a book or a
				tablet which might shed light on their past, nor have the
				Jewish historians and writers of the non-Arab world made
				any mention of them. The reason being that after their
				settlement in the Arabian peninsula, they had detached
				themselves from the main body of the Jewish nation, and
				the Jews of the world did not count them among
				themselves. They had given up the Hebrew culture and
				language, even the names, and adopted Arabism instead. In
				tablets that have been unearthed in archaeological
				research in the Hijaz, no trace of the Jews is found
				before the first century of the Christian era, except for
				a few Jewish names. Therefore, the history of the Arabian
				Jews is based mostly on the verbal traditions prevalent
				among the Arabs most of which bad been spread by the Jews
				themselves.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Jews of the Hijaz claimed that they had come to
				settle in Arabia during the last stage of the life of the
				Prophet Moses (peace be upon him). They said that the
				Prophet Moses had despatched an army to expel the
				Amalekites from the land of Yathrib and had commanded it
				not to spare even a single soul of that tribe. The
				Israelite army carried out the Prophet's command, but
				spared the life of a handsome prince of the Amalekite
				king and returned with him to Palestine. By that time the
				Prophet Moses had passed away. His successors took great
				exception to what the army had done, for by sparing the
				life of an Amalekite, it had clearly disobeyed the
				Prophet and violated the Mosaic law. Consequently, they
				excluded the army from their community, and it had to
				return to Yathrib and settle there forever. (Kitab
				al-Aghani, vol. xix, p. 94). Thus the Jews claimed that
				they had been living in Yathrib since about 1200 B.C.
				But, this had in fact no historical basis. The Jews
				probably had invented this story in order to overawe the
				Arabs into believing that they were of noble lineage and
				the original inhabitants of the land.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second Jewish immigration, according to the Jews,
				took, place in 587 BC. when Nebuchadnezzer, the King of
				Babylon, destroyed Jerusalem and dispersed the Jews
				throughout the world. The Arab Jews said that several of
				their tribes at that time had come to settle in Wadi
				al-Qura, Taima, and Yathrib. (Al-Baladhuri, Futuh
				al-Buldan). But this too has no historical basis. By this
				they also might have wanted to prove that they were the
				original settlers of the area.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a matter of fact, in A. D. 70 the Romans massacred the
				Jews in Palestine, and then in A. D. 132 expelled them
				from that land, many of the Jewish tribes fled to find an
				asylum in the Hijaz, a territory that was contiguous to
				Palestine in the south. There they settled wherever they
				found water springs and greenery, and then by intrigue
				and through money lending business gradually occupied the
				fertile lands. Ailah, Maqna, Tabuk, Taima, Wadi al Qura,
				Fadak and Khayber came under their control in that very
				period, and Bani Quraizah, Bani al-Nadhir, Bani Bahdal
				and Bani Qainuqa also came in the same period and
				occupied Yathrib.
			</p>
			<p>
				Among the tribes that settled in Yathrib the Bani
				An-Nadhir and the Bani Quraizah were more prominent for
				they belonged to the Cohen or priest class. They were
				looked upon as of noble descent and enjoyed religious
				leadership among their co-religionists. When they came to
				settle in Madinah there were some other tribes already
				living there. They subdued them and became the owners of
				this green and fertile land. About three centuries later,
				in A. D. 450 or 451, the great flood of Yaman occurred
				which has been mentioned in vv. 16-17 of Surah Saba. As a
				result of this, different tribes of the people of Saba
				were compelled to leave Yaman and disperse to different
				parts of Arabia. Thus, the Bani Ghassan went to settle in
				Syria, Bani Lakhm in Hirah (Iraq), Bani Khuza'ah between
				Jeddah and Makkah and the Aus and the Khazraj went to
				settle in Yathrib. As Yathrib was under Jewish
				domination, they at first did not allow the Aus and the
				Khazraj to gain a footing and the two Arab tribes had to
				settle on lands that had not yet been brought under
				cultivation. There they could hardly produce enough to
				enable them to survive. At last, one of their chiefs went
				to Syria to ask for the assistance of their Ghassanide
				brothers; he brought an army from there and broke the
				power of the Jews. Thus, the Aus and the Khazraj were
				able to gain complete dominance over Yathrib, with the
				result that two of the major Jewish tribes, Bani
				an-Nadhir and Bani Quraiza were forced to take quarters
				outside the city. Since the third tribe, Bani Qainuqa,
				was not on friendly terms with the other two tribes, it
				stayed inside the city as usual, but had to seek
				protection of the Khazraj tribe. As a counter measure to
				this, Bani an-Nadhir and Bani Quraizah took protection of
				the Aus tribe so that they could live in peace in the
				suburbs of Yathrib.
			</p>
			<p>
				Before the Prophet's arrival at Madinah and until his
				emigration, the following were the main features of the
				Jews position in Hijaz in general and in Yathrib in
				particular
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					In the matter of language, dress, civilization
					and way of life they had completely adopted
					Arabism, even their names had become Arabian. Of
					the 12 Jewish tribes that had settled in Hijaz,
					none except the Bani Zaura retained its Hebrew
					name.
				</li>
				<li>
					Because of this Arabism, the western orientalists
					have been misled into thinking that perhaps they
					were not really Israelites but Arabs who had
					embraced Judaism, or that at least a majority of
					them were Arab Jews. But there is no historical
					proof to show that the Jews ever engaged in the
					propagation of Judaism in Hijaz, or that their
					rabbis invited the Arabs to embrace Judaism like
					the Christian priests and missionaries. On the
					contrary, they prided themselves upon their
					Israelite descent and racial prejudices. They
					called the Arabs Gentiles, which did not mean
					illiterate or uneducated, but savage and
					uncivilized people. They believed that the
					Gentiles were not entitled to any human rights,
					these were reserved only for the Israelites, and
					therefore, it was lawful and right for the
					Israelites to defraud them of their properties by
					every means.
				</li>
				<li>
					Economically they were much stronger than the
					Arabs. Since they had emigrated from the more
					civilized and culturally advanced countries of
					Palestine and Syria, they knew many such arts
					that were unknown to the Arabs; they also enjoyed
					trade relations with the outside world. Hence,
					they had captured the business of importing grain
					in Yathrib and the upper Hijaz and exporting
					dried dates to other countries. Poultry farming
					and fishing also were mostly under their
					controls. They excelled at cloth weaving as well.
					The Jews had also set up wine shops in different
					areas, where they sold wine which was imported
					from Syria.
				</li>
				<li>
					They would not allow the Arabs to be united and,
					therefore, kept them fighting and entrenched
					against each other. They knew that whenever the
					Arab tribes united, they would not allow the Jews
					to remain in possession of their large
					properties, gardens and fertile lands, which they
					had come to own through their profiteering and
					money lending businesses. 
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Such were the conditions when Islam came to Madinah, and
				ultimately an Islamic State came into existence after the
				Prophet's (upon whom be Allah's peace) arrival there. One
				of the first things that he accomplished was unification
				of the Aus, the Khazraj and the Emigrants into a
				brotherhood. The second was that he concluded a treaty
				between the Muslims and the Jews on definite conditions,
				in which it was pledged that neither party would encroach
				on the rights of the other, and both would unite in a
				joint defence against the external enemies. Some
				important clauses of this treaty are as follows. They
				clearly show what the Jews and the Muslims had pledged to
				adhere to in their mutual relationship:
			</p>
			<p>
				"The Jews must bear their expenses and the Muslims their
				expenses. Each must help the other against anyone who
				attacks the people of this document. They must seek
				mutual advice and consultation, and loyalty is a
				protection against treachery. They shall sincerely wish
				one another well. Their relations will be governed by
				piety and recognition of the rights of others, and not by
				sin and wrongdoing. The wronged must be helped. The Jews
				must pay with the believers so long as the war lasts.
				Yathrib shall be a sanctuary for the people of this
				document. If any dispute or controversy likely to cause
				trouble should arise, it must be referred to God and to
				Muhammad the Apostle of God; the Qureysh and their
				helpers shall not be given protection. The contracting
				parties are bound to help one another against any attack
				on Yathrib. Every one shall be responsible for the
				defense of the portion to which he belongs." (Ibn Hisham,
				vol. ii, pp. 147 to 150)
			</p>
			<p>
				This was on absolute and definitive covenant to the
				conditions of which the Jews themselves had agreed. But
				not very long after this they began to show hostility
				towards the Prophet of Allah (upon whom be Allah's
				peace). Islam and the Muslims, and their hostility and
				perverseness continued increasing day by day. Its main
				causes were the following three:
			</p>
			<p>
				First, they envisaged the Prophet (upon whom be Allah's
				peace) merely as a chief of his people, who should be
				content to have concluded a political agreement with them
				and should only concern himself with the worldly
				interests of his group. But they found that he was
				extending an invitation to believe in Allah, His Rasool
				and the Book (which also included belief in their own
				Prophets and scriptures).
			</p>
			<p>
				He was urging the people to give up disobedience of Allah
				and adopt obedience to the Divine Commands and abide by
				the moral laws of their own prophets. This they could not
				agree with. They feared that if this universal
				ideological movement gained momentum, it would destroy
				their rigid religiosity and wipe out their racial
				nationhood.
			</p>
			<p>
				Second, when they saw that the Aus, the Khazraj and the
				Emigrants were uniting into a brotherhood and the people
				from the Arab tribes of the surrounding areas, who
				entered Islam, were also joining this Islamic Brotherhood
				of Madinah and forming a religious community. They feared
				that the selfish policy that they had been following of
				sowing discord between the Arab tribes for the promotion
				of their own well being and interests for centuries,
				would not work in the new system. They knew that they
				would inevitably face a united front of the Arabs against
				which their intrigues would not succeed.
			</p>
			<p>
				Third, the work that the Messenger of Allah (upon whom be
				Allah's peace) was carrying out of reforming the society
				and civilization included putting an end to all unlawful
				methods in business and mutual dealings. Moreover, he had
				declared the taking and giving of usury as impure and
				unlawful earning. This caused them the fear that, if his
				rule became established in Arabia, he would declare
				interest legally forbidden. In this they saw their own
				economic disaster and death.
			</p>
			<p>
				For these reasons they made resistance and opposition to
				the Prophet their national ideal. They would not hesitate
				to employ any trick, any device and cunning, to harm him.
				They spread every kind of falsehood so as to cause
				distrust against him in the people's minds. They created
				every kind of doubt, suspicion and misgiving in the
				hearts of the new converts so as to turn them back from
				Islam. They would resort to every kind of deceit and
				fraud in order to harm the Muslims economically. Whenever
				one with whom they had business dealings with would
				accept Islam, they would do whatever they could to cause
				him financial loss. If he owed them something, they would
				fret and harass him by making repeated demands, and if
				they owed him something, they would withhold the payment
				and would publicly say that, at the time the bargain was
				made, he professed a different religion, and since he had
				changed his religion, they were no longer under any
				obligation to repay him. Several instances of this nature
				are cited in the commentaries by Tabari, Nisaburi,
				Tabrizi and in Ruh al Ma'ani relating to verse 75 of
				Surah Al-Imran.
			</p>
			<p>
				They had adopted this hostile attitude against the
				covenant even before the Battle of Badr. But when the
				Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) and the Muslims won
				a decisive victory over the Qureysh at Badr, they were
				filled with grief, anguish, malice and anger. Ka'b bin
				Ashraf, the chief of the Bani an-Nadhir, cried out: "By
				God, if Muhammad has actually killed these nobles of
				Arabia, the earth's belly would be better for us than its
				back." Then he went to Makkah and incited the people to
				vengeance by writing and reciting provocative elegies for
				the Qureysh chiefs killed at Badr. Then he returned to
				Madinah and composed lyrical verses of an insulting
				nature about Muslim women. At last, enraged with Ka'b Bin
				Ashraf's mischief, the Prophet (pbuh) sentenced him to
				death. (Ibn Sad, Ibn Hisham, Tabari).
			</p>
			<p>
				The first Jewish tribe which, after the Battle of Badr,
				openly and collectively broke their covenant were the
				Bani Qainuqa. They lived in a locality inside the city of
				Madinah. As they practised the crafts of the goldsmith,
				blacksmith and vessel maker, the people of Madinah
				visited their shops fairly frequently. They were proud of
				their bravery and velour. Being blacksmiths by
				profession, even their children were well armed. They
				could instantly muster 700 fighting men from among
				themselves. They were also arrogantly aware that they
				enjoyed relations of confederacy with the Khazraj and
				Abdullah bin Ubayy, the chief of the, Khazraj, was their
				chief supporter. At the victory at Badr, they became so
				provoked that they began to trouble and harass the
				Muslims; Muslim women in particular, who visited their
				shops. By and by things came to such a pass that one day
				a Muslim woman was stripped naked publicly in their
				bazaar. This led to a brawl in which a Muslim and a Jew
				were killed. The Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace)
				himself visited the local Jewish tribe, got them together
				and counselled them on decent conduct. But the reply that
				they gave was; "O Muhammad, you perhaps think we are like
				the Qureysh; they did not know fighting; therefore, you
				overpowered them. But, when you come in contact with us,
				you will see how men fight." This was in clear words a
				declaration of war. Consequently, the Prophet (upon whom
				be Allah's peace) laid siege to their quarters in A. H.
				2. The siege had hardly lasted for a fortnight when they
				surrendered and all their fighting men were bound and
				taken prisoners. Abdullah bin Ubayy came up in support of
				them and requested that they should be pardoned. The Holy
				Prophet conceded his request and decided that the Bani
				Qainuqa would be exiled from Madinah leaving their
				properties, armor and tools of trade behind. (Ibn Sa'd,
				Ibn Hisham, Tarikh Tabari).
			</p>
			<p>
				For some time after these punitive measures (i. e. the
				banishment of the Qainuqa and killing of Ka'b bin Ashraf
				) the Jews remained so terror stricken that they did not
				dare commit any further mischief. But later in Shawwal,
				A. H. 3 the Qureysh, in order to avenge themselves for
				the defeat at Badr, marched against Madinah with great
				preparations. The Jews saw that only one thousand men had
				marched out with the Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace)
				in comparison to three thousand men of the Qureysh. To
				make matter worse 300 hypocrites initially joined the
				Prophet, deserted and returned to Madinah. At this point,
				they committed the first and open breach of the treaty by
				refusing to join the Prophet in the defense of the city
				even though they were bound to it by the agreement. Then,
				when in the Battle of Uhud the Muslims suffered a set
				back, they were further emboldened. So much so that the
				Bani an-Nadhir made a secret plan to kill the Prophet
				(pbuh). The plan, however, failed before it could be
				executed.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a result, there was no question of showing them any
				further concession. The Holy Prophet at once sent to them
				the ultimatum that the treachery they had meditated
				against him had come to his knowledge. Therefore, they
				were to leave Madinah within ten days. If anyone of them
				was found staying behind in their quarters, he would be
				put to the sword. Meanwhile, Abdullah bin Ubayy sent them
				the message that he would help them with two thousand men
				and that the Bani Quraizah and Bani Ghatfan would also
				come to their aid. Therefore, they were to stand firm and
				not go. On this false assurance, they responded to the
				Prophet's ultimatum saying that they would not leave
				Madinah and that he could do whatever was in his power.
				Consequently, in Rabi-al-Awwal, A. H. 4, the Prophet
				(pbuh) laid siege to them, and after a few days of the
				siege they surrendered on the condition that they could
				take their personal property, except the armor, which
				could be carried on three camels. Thus, Madinah was rid
				of this second mischievous tribe of Jews. Only two of the
				Bani an-Nadhir embraced Islam and stayed behind. All of
				the others went to Syria and Khayber.

		<section heading="Theme">
			<p>
				The detail of three issues on which this Surah provided
				guidance:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					A strong exception is taken to the act of
					Sayyiduna Hatib bin Abi Balta'a who, a little
					before the conquest of Makkah, had sent a secret
					letter to the Qureysh chiefs informing them of
					the Prophet's intention to attack them. He had
					tried to inform the enemy of a very important war
					secret of the Prophet (upon whom be Allah's
					peace) only for the sake of safe guarding his
					family. This would have caused great bloodshed at
					the conquest of Makkah had it not been made
					ineffective in time. It would have cost the
					Muslims many precious lives; many of the Qureysh
					would have been killed, many of whom would have
					rendered great services to Islam afterward; the
					gains which were to accrue from conquering Makkah
					peacefully would have been lost. All of these
					serious losses would have resulted only because
					one of the Muslims had wanted to safeguard his
					family from the dangers of war. Administering a
					severe warning at this blunder Allah has taught
					the believers the lesson that no believer should,
					under any circumstances and for any motive, have
					relations of love and friendship with the
					disbelievers who are actively hostile to Islam,
					and a believer should refrain from everything
					which might be helpful to them in the conflict
					between Islam and disbelief. However, there is no
					harm in dealing kindly and justly with those
					disbelievers who may not be practically engaged
					in hostile activities against Islam and the
					persecution of the Muslims.
				</li>
				<li>
					A very serious social problem is addressed which
					was agitating the minds of the Muslims at that
					time. There were many Muslim women in Makkah,
					whose husbands were pagans, but they were
					emigrating and reaching Madinah somehow. The
					second relates to the Muslim women who had
					started emigrating from Makkah to Madinah after
					the conclusion of the Truce of Hudeybiyah. The
					problem arose whether they also were to be
					returned to the disbelievers, like the Muslim
					men, according to the conditions of the truce.
					Likewise, there were many Muslim men in Madinah
					whose wives were pagans and had been left behind
					in Makkah. The question arose whether the
					marriage bond between them continued to be valid
					or not. Allah settled this problem forever,
					saying that the pagan husband is not lawful for
					the Muslim woman, nor the pagan wife lawful for
					the Muslim husband.
				</li>
				<li>
					The Holy Prophet (pbuh) has been instructed to
					ask the women who accept Islam to pledge that
					they would refrain from the major evils that were
					prevalent among the womenfolk of the pre-Islamic
					Arab society, and to promise that they would
					henceforth follow the ways of goodness which the
					Rasool of Allah may enjoin.

				This Surah exhorts the Muslims to adopt sincerity in
				Faith and to struggle with their lives in the cause of
				Allah. It is addressed to Muslims of weak faith as well
				as to those who entered Islam as a cover-up. The
				believers are warned; "Allah hates those people who say

				the cause of Truth like a solid wall against the enemies

				Their attitude towards their Rasool and their Religion

				The first section was revealed after the final defeat of
				the Jewish tribes at the Battle of Khayber. Allah
				Almighty revealed this last and final address which was
				directed towards the Jews in the Qur'an. In this they are
				reminded of three things:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Did you refuse to believe in Muhammad (pbuh) only
					because he was born among a people whom you
					considered 'gentiles'? You were under the false
					delusion that a Rasool must necessarily belong to
					your own community and that anyone who claimed to
					be a Prophet outside your own community must be
					an imposter. This is Allah's bounty, which He may
					bestow on anyone He may please. You have not been
					granted a monopoly over it.
				</li>
				<li>
					You were made the bearers of the Torah, but you
					did not undertake your responsibility and
					discharge it as you should have. Therefore you
					are no better than that donkey who is loaded with
					books and does not know what burden he is
					bearing. You not only shirk your responsibility
					of being the bearers of Allah's book, but you did
					not even hesitate to deliberately deny Allah's
					revelations. Yet you consider yourselves as
					Allah's favorites.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you really consider yourselves as Allah's
					favorites and were sure of having a place of
					honor and high rank with Him you would not have
					feared death and accepted a life of disgrace and
					subjugation. This condition itself is proof that
					you are fully conscious of your misdeeds, and
					your conscience is aware that if you die with
					these misdeeds, you will meet your Rabb with a
					greater disgrace on the Day of Judgement.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				In the second section, Allah warned the Muslims not to
				treat their Friday as the Jews had treated their Sabbath.
				This section was sent down on the occasion when a trade
				caravan arrived in Madinah right at the time of Friday
				congregation prayer. During the service when the people
				heard the din and drum, they left the Prophet's mosque
				and rushed to the caravan although the Prophet was
				delivering the Sermon. Thereupon it was enjoined that
				when the call for the Friday Prayer was made all trade,
				business and other occupation must stop. Upon hearing the
				call, believers should suspend every kind of transaction
				and hasten to the remembrance of Allah. However, when the
				prayer is over they can go back and resume their normal
				business.

		<section heading="History">
			<p>
				Before mentioning the particular incident about which
				this Surah was revealed, it is necessary to have a look
				at the history of the hypocrites of Madinah. The incident
				that occurred on this occasion was not a chance
				happening, but had a whole series of events behind it,
				all of which ultimately led up to it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Before the Prophet's migration to Madinah the tribes of
				the Aus and the Khazraj, fed up with their mutual
				rivalries and civil wars, had almost agreed on the
				leadership of one man and were making preparations to
				crown him their king. This was Abdullah bin Ubayy bin
				Salul, the chief of the Khazraj. Muhammad bin Ishaq has
				stated that among the people of Khazraj his authority was
				never contested and never had the Aus and the Khazraj
				rallied to one man before this.
			</p>
			<p>
				When the Prophet arrived in Madinah, Islam had so deeply
				penetrated every house of the Ansar that Abdullah bin
				Ubayy became helpless and did not see any other way to
				save his leadership than to become a Muslim himself. So,
				he entered Islam along with many of his followers from
				among the chiefs and leaders of both the tribes although
				their hearts were burning with rage from within. Ibn
				Ubayy in particular was filled with grief, for the
				Prophet (pbuh) had deprived him of his kingship. For
				several years his hypocritical faith and grief of being
				deprived of his kingdom manifested itself in different
				ways. On the one hand, when on Fridays the Prophet (pbuh)
				took his seat to deliver the Sermon, Abdullah bin Ubayy
				would stand up and say "O people, the Rasool of Allah is
				present among you, by whom Allah has honored you;
				therefore, you should support him, listen to what he says
				and obey him." (Ibn Hisham, vol. III, p. 111). On the
				other, his hypocrisy was being exposed day by day and the
				true Muslims were realizing that he and his followers
				bore great malice against Islam, the Prophet and the
				Muslims.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Summary of the hypocrites behavior:">
			<ol>
				<li>
					Once when the Prophet was passing along the way,
					Abdullah bin Ubayy spoke to him in harsh words.
					When the Prophet complained of it to Sayyiduna
					Sa'd bin Ubadah, he said: "O Rasool of Allah,
					don't be hard on him, for when Allah sent you to
					us we were about to crown him, and, by God, he
					thinks that you have robbed him of his kingdom."
					(Ibn Hisham vol: II, pp. 237-238).
				</li>
				<li>
					After the Battle of Badr when the Prophet (pbuh)
					invaded the Jewish tribe of Bani Qainuqa for
					breaking their agreement and unprovoked revolt,
					this man stood up in support of them, and holding
					the Prophet by his armor, said: "These 700
					fighters have been helping and protecting me
					against every enemy; would you cut them down in
					one morning? By God, I will not leave you until
					you pardon my clients." (Ibn Hisham, vol. III,
					pp. 5l-52)
				</li>
				<li>
					On the occasion of the Battle of Uhud this man
					committed open treachery and withdrew from the
					battlefield with 300 of his companions. One
					should note that at this critical moment when he
					so acted, the Qureysh had marched upon Madinah
					with 3,000 troops and the Prophet had marched out
					with only 1,000 men to resist them. Of these
					1,000 this hypocrite broke away with 300 men and
					the Prophet was left with only 700 men to meet
					3,000 troops of the enemy on the field. After
					this incident the common Muslims of Madinah came
					to realize that he was certainly a hypocrite and
					so were his companions. That is why when on the
					very first Friday, after the Battle of Uhud, this
					man stood up as usual to make a speech before the
					Prophet's Sermon, the people pulled at his
					garment, saying "Sit down you are not worthy to
					say any thing." That was the first occasion in
					Madinah when this man was publicly disgraced.
					Thereupon he was so filled with rage that he left
					the mosque jumping over the heads of the people.
					At the door of the Mosque some of the Ansar said
					to him, "What are you doing? Go back and ask the
					Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) to pray for
					your forgiveness." He retorted "I do not want him
					to pray for my forgiveness." (Ibn Hisham, vol.
					III, p. 111)
				</li>
				<li>
					In A. H. 4 the Battle of Bani an-Nadir took
					place. On this occasion he and his companions
					supported the enemies of Islam even more openly.
					On the one side, the Prophet (pbuh) and his
					devoted companions were preparing for war against
					their enemy, the Jews, and on the other, these
					hypocrites were secretly sending messages to the
					Jews to the effect: "Stand firm we are with you:
					if you are attacked, we will help you, and if you
					are driven out, we too will go out with you." The
					secret of this intrigue was exposed by Allah
					Himself, as has been explained in Surah Al-Hashr
					verses 11-17. Inspite of being so exposed the
					reason why the Prophet (pbuh) was still treating
					him kindly was that he had a large band of the
					hypocrites behind him. Many of the chiefs of both
					the Aus and the Khazraj were his supporters. At
					least a third of the population of Madinah
					consisted of his companions, as became manifest
					on the occasion of the Battle of Uhud. Under such
					conditions it was not prudent to wage a war with
					these internal and external enemies combined. On
					this very account, inspite of being fully aware
					of their hypocrisy, the Prophet for a long time
					continued to deal with them according to their
					apparent profession of faith.
				</li>
				<li>
					When Abdullah bin Ubayy, and like minded
					hypocrites, got an opportunity to accompany the
					Prophet (pbuh) in his campaign against the Bani
					Al- Mustaliq, they engineered two great mischiefs
					which could shatter the Muslim unity to pieces.
					However, by virtue of the wonderful training in
					discipline that the Muslims had received through
					the pure teaching of the Qur'an and the
					companionship of the Prophet (pbuh) both
					mischiefs were stopped in time, and the
					hypocrites themselves were disgraced instead. One
					of these was the mischief that is mentioned in
					Surah An-Nur, and the other in this Surah. These
					incidents are related by Bukhari, Muslim, Ahmed,
					Nasai, Tirmidhi, Baihaqi, Tabari, Ibn Marduyah,
					Abdur Razzaq, lbn Jarir Tabari, Ibn Sa'd and
					Muhammad bin Ishaq through many reliable
					channels.

			<p>
				The theme of this Surah is an invitation to the Faith,
				obedience (to Allah) and the teaching of good morals. The
				sequence followed is that the first four verses are
				addressed to all men; verses 5-10 to those men who do not
				believe in the invitation of the Qur'an; and verses 11-
				l8 to those who accept and believe in this invitation. In
				the verses addressed to all men, they have been made
				aware in a few brief sentences of the following four
				truths:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					That the universe in which you live is not
					Godless, but its Creator, Master and Ruler is an
					All Powerful Allah, and everything in it
					testifies to His being Who is perfect and
					absolutely faultless.
				</li>
				<li>
					That the universe is not without purpose and
					wisdom. Its Creator has created it to manifest
					the truth. No one should be under the delusion
					that it is just a show, which began without a
					purpose and will come to an end without a
					purpose.
				</li>
				<li>
					That the excellent form that Allah has created
					you with and the choice that He has given you to
					choose between belief and unbelief is not a
					useless and meaningless activity so that it may
					be of no consequence whether you choose belief or
					unbelief. In fact, God is watching as to how you
					exercise your choice.
				</li>
				<li>
					That you have not been created irresponsible and
					unanswerable. You are to return ultimately to
					your Creator, and will meet the Being who is
					aware of everything in the universe, from Whom
					nothing is hidden, and to Whom even the innermost
					thoughts of peoples' minds are known.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				After stating these truths about the Universe and Man,
				the address turns to the disbelievers and their attention
				is drawn to the two causes of prior nation's destruction:
			</p>
			<ol type="A">
				<li>
					They refused to believe in the Rasools whom Allah
					sent for their guidance, with the result that
					Allah too left them to themselves, and that they
					invented their own philosophies of life and went
					on groping their way from one error to another.
				</li>
				<li>
					They rejected the doctrine of the Hereafter, and
					thought this worldly life to be an end in itself,
					and believed that there was no life hereafter
					where they will render an account of their deeds
					before Allah. This corrupted their attitude
					towards life, and their morals and character
					became so polluted that eventually the scourge of
					Allah came and eliminated them from the scene.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				After stating these historical facts, the disbelievers
				are admonished to wake up and believe in Allah, His
				Rasool and the Light of Guidance that Allah has sent in
				the form of The Qur'an if they want to avoid the fate met
				by the former peoples. Besides, they are warned that the
				Day shall eventually come when all the former and the
				latter generations will be gathered in one place and the
				misdeeds committed by each will be exposed before all
				mankind. Then addressing the believers, a few important
				instructions are given:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Whatever affliction befalls a person in the
					world, it befalls with Allah's leave. Whoever in
					this state of affliction remains steadfast to the
					Faith, Allah blesses his heart with guidance.
				</li>
				<li>
					The believer is not required to affirm the Faith
					with the tongue only, but after the affirmation
					of the Faith he should practically obey Allah and
					His Messenger. If he turns away from obedience he
					would himself be responsible for his loss.
				</li>
				<li>
					The believer should place his trust in Allah
					alone and not in any other power of this world.
				</li>
				<li>
					Worldly goods and children are a trial for it is
					their love that generally distracts man from the
					path of Allah and His obedience. Therefore, the
					believers should beware of this fact about their
					children, and wives lest they directly or
					indirectly become robbers for them on the Way of
					Allah ; and that they should spend their wealth
					for the sake of Allah so that their self remains
					safe against the temptations of Satan.
				</li>
				<li>
					Every person is responsible only to the extent of
					his power and ability. Allah does not demand that
					man should exert himself beyond his power and
					ability. However, the believer should try his
					best to live in fear of Allah as much as
					possible, and should see that he does not
					transgress the limits set by Allah in his speech,
					conduct and dealings.

			<p>
				In order to understand the commandments of this Surah, it
				is useful to refresh one's memory about the regulations
				which were given concerning divorce and the waiting
				period (Iddat).
			</p>
			<p>
				"Divorce may be pronounced twice; then the wife may
				either be kept back in fairness or allowed to separate in
				fairness." (Al Baqarah 229)
			</p>
			<p>
				"And the divorced women (after the pronouncement of the
				divorce) must wait for three monthly courses and their
				husbands are fully entitled to take them back (as their
				wives) during this waiting period, if they desire
				reconciliation." (Al Baqarah 228)
			</p>
			<p>
				"Then, if the husband divorces his wife (for the third
				time), she shall not remain lawful for him after this
				divorce, unless she marries another husband..."
				(Al-Baqarah : 230)
			</p>
			<p>
				"When you marry the believing women, and then divorce
				them before you have touched them, they do not have to
				observe a waiting period, the completion of which you may
				demand of them." (Al-Ahzab : 49)
			</p>
			<p>
				"And if those of you who die, leave wives behind, the
				women should abstain (from marriage) for four months and
				ten days." (Al-Baqarah 234)
			</p>
			<p>
				The rules prescribed in these verses are as follows: 
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					A man can pronounce at the most three divorces on
					his wife.
				</li>
				<li>
					In case the husband has pronounced one or two
					divorces he is entitled to take the woman back as
					his wife within the waiting period, and if after
					the expiration of the waiting period the two
					desire to remarry, they can remarry and there is
					no condition of legalization (tahlil). But if the
					husband has pronounced three divorces, he
					forfeits his right to keep her as his wife within
					the waiting period, and they cannot remarry
					unless the woman marries another husband and he
					subsequently divorces her of his own free will.
				</li>
				<li>
					The waiting period of the woman, who menstruates
					and marriage with whom has been consummated, is
					that she should pass three monthly courses. The
					waiting period in case of one or two divorces is
					that the woman is still the legal wife of the
					husband and he can take her back as his wife
					within the waiting period. But if the husband has
					pronounced three divorces, this waiting period
					cannot be taken advantage of for the purpose of
					reconciliation, but is only meant to restrain the
					woman from remarrying another person before it
					comes to an end.
				</li>
				<li>
					There is no waiting period for the woman, who is
					divorced even before the marriage is consummated.
					She can remarry, if she likes, immediately after
					the divorce.
				</li>
				<li>
					The waiting period of the woman whose husband
					dies is four months and ten days.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				One should understand that Surah At-Talaq was not sent
				down to annul or amend any of these rules, but was sent
				down for two purposes: 
			</p>
			<ol type="A">
				<li>
					The man who has been given the right to pronounce
					divorce should be taught such judicious methods
					of using this right so that it may not needlessly
					lead to separation. However, if separation does
					take place, it should only be when all
					possibilities of mutual reconciliation have been
					exhausted. In Divine Law, provision for divorce
					has been made only as an unavoidable necessity.
					Allah does not approve of the dissolution of a
					marriage. The Prophet (upon whom be Allah's
					peace) has said: "Allah has not made lawful
					anything more hateful in His sight than divorce."
					(Abu Daud). And: "Of all the things permitted by
					the Law, the most hateful in the sight of Allah
					is the divorce." (Abu Daud)
				</li>
				<li>
					The object was to complement this section of the
					family law of Islam by supplying answers to the
					questions that had remained after the revelation
					of the commandments in Surah Al-Baqarah. Answers
					are given to the following questions:
				</li>
			</ol>
			<ol>
				<li>
					What would be the waiting period of women,
					marriage with whom has been consummated and who
					no longer menstruate or those who have not yet
					menstruated, in case they are divorced?
				</li>
				<li>
					What would be the waiting period of the woman,
					who is pregnant, or the woman whose husband dies,
					if she is divorced?
				</li>
				<li>
					What arrangements would be made for the
					maintenance and lodging of the different
					categories of divorced women, and for the
					fosterage of the child whose parents have
					separated on account of a divorce?

				This is a very important Surah in which guidance is
				provided relating to questions of grave significance in
				reference to some incidents concerning the wives of the
				Prophet (pbuh).
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					That the powers to prescribe the bounds of the
					lawful and the unlawful, the permissible and the
					forbidden, are entirely and absolutely in the
					hand of Allah and nothing of this sort has been
					delegated even to the Prophet of Allah, much less
					any other person.
				</li>
				<li>
					That in any society the position of a Prophet is
					very delicate. A minor incident experienced by an
					ordinary man in his life may not be of any
					consequence, but it assumes the status of law
					when experienced by a Prophet. That is why the
					lives of the Prophets have been kept under close
					supervision by Allah so that none of their acts,
					not even a most trivial one, may deviate from
					Divine Will.
				</li>
				<li>
					The Prophet (pbuh) was checked on a minor thing,
					which was not only corrected but also recorded.
					It gives us complete satisfaction that whatever
					actions, commands and instructions we now find in
					the documented life of the Prophet concerning
					which there is nothing on record in the nature of
					criticism or correction from Allah. We can trust
					that they are wholly based on truth, are in
					complete conformity with Divine Will and that
					guidance can be drawn from them with full
					confidence and peace of mind.
				</li>
				<li>
					It has been stated in this Surah that the
					Prophet, whose reverence and respect Allah
					Himself has enjoined as a necessary part of the
					faith of His servants, once during his sacred
					life made a thing declared lawful by Allah
					unlawful for himself only to please his wives.
					Allah severely reproved of their errors, the
					wives of the Prophet whom Allah Himself has
					declared as mothers of the faithful; worthy of
					the highest esteem and honor. Further, this
					criticism of the Prophet and the administration
					of the warning to his wives was made not secretly
					but included in the Book, which the entire Ummah
					has to read and recite forever. Obviously, the
					intention of making mention of this instance in
					the Book of Allah was not, nor could it have
					been, that Allah wanted to degrade His Rasool and
					the Mothers of the Faithful in the eyes of the
					believers. It is also obvious that no Muslim has
					lost respect for them after reading this Surah of
					the Qur'an. There cannot be any other reason of
					mentioning this instance in the Qur'an other than
					that Allah wants to acquaint the believers with
					the correct manner of reverence for their
					personalities. A Prophet is a Prophet, not God,
					and he may commit error. Respect of the Prophet
					has not been enjoined because he is infallible,
					but because he is a perfect representative of
					Divine Will, and Allah has not permitted any of
					his errors to pass unnoticed. This gives us the
					satisfaction that the noble pattern of life left
					by the Prophet wholly and fully represents the
					Will of Allah.
				</li>
				<li>
					It is made explicitly clear that Allah's religion
					is absolutely fair and just. It has for every
					person just the recompense of which he becomes
					worthy of on the basis of his faith and works. No
					relationship or connection, even with the most
					righteous person or the most evil person, can be
					beneficial for him in any way. In reference to
					this, three kinds of women have been cited as
					examples before the the Prophet's wives in
					particular.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<ol type="A">
				<li>
					One example is of the wives of the Prophets Noah
					and Lot, who, if they had believed and cooperated
					with their illustrious husbands, would have
					occupied the same rank and position in the Muslim
					community which is enjoyed by the wives of the
					Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). Since they were
					disbelievers, however, their being the wives of
					the Prophets did not save them from hell.
				</li>
				<li>
					The second example is of the wife of Pharaoh, who
					in spite of being the wife of a staunch enemy of
					God believed and chose a path of action separate
					from that followed by the Pharaoh's people. Her
					being the wife of a staunch disbeliever did not
					cause her any harm, and Allah made her worthy of
					Paradise.
				</li>
				<li>
					The third example is of Sayyidah Maryam (Mary)
					(peace be upon her), who attained to her high
					rank because she submitted to the severe test
					Allah decided to put her too. Apart from Maryam,
					no other chaste and righteous woman in history
					has been put to such a difficult test. In spite
					of being unmarried she was miraculously made
					pregnant by Allah's command and informed of the
					service her Rabb willed to take from her. When
					Sayyidah Maryam accepted this decision, and
					agreed to bear, like a true believer, everything
					that she inevitably had to bear in order to
					fulfil Allah's Will, then did Allah exalt her to
					the noble rank of "Sayyidahtu an-Nisa''
					Fil-Jannah (Leader of the women in Paradise)."
					(Musnad Ahmed).

				We also learn from this Surah that the Prophet (pbuh) did
				not receive from Allah only that knowledge which is
				included and recorded in The Qur'an, but was additionally
				given information about other things also by revelation,
				which was not recorded in The Qur'an. Clear proof of this
				is found in verse 3 of this Surah. In it we are told that
				the Prophet (pbuh) confided a secret to one of his wives,
				and she told it to another. Allah informed the Prophet of
				this secret. Then, when the Prophet warned his particular
				wife on this mistake of disclosure she said: "Who has
				informed you of this mistake of mine?" He replied: "I
				have been informed of it by Him Who knows everything and
				is All Aware." The question is where in the Qur'an is the
				verse in which Allah has said "O Prophet, the secret that
				you had confided to one of your wives has been disclosed
				by her to another person?" There is no such verse in the
				Qur'an. This is an express proof of the fact that some
				times revelation thet descended on the Prophet was not
				included in the Qur'an, and refutes the claim of the
				deniers of Hadith, who allege that nothing was sent down
				to the Prophet (pbuh) apart from the Qur'an.

				In this Surah the basic teachings of Islam are briefly
				mentioned. In a most effective way, people are made to
				realize that the universe in which they live is a well
				organized and fortified Kingdom in which no fault,
				weakness or flaw can be detected no matter how hard they
				may try. This Kingdom has been created from nothing and
				brought into existence by Allah Almighty Himself. All of
				the powers of controlling, administering and ruling it
				are also entirely in Allah's hands . This system is not
				created without purpose and people have been sent here
				for a test. In this test they can succeed only by their
				righteous deeds and conduct. Then the dreadful
				consequences of disbelief which will appear in the
				Hereafter, are mentioned. The people are told that Allah,
				by sending His Prophets, has forewarned them of these
				consequences.
			</p>
			<p>
				Emphasis is made on the fact that the Creator is aware of
				each open and hidden secret of men, even the innermost
				ideas of their hearts. The right basis of morality is
				that man should avoid evil and fear the accountability by
				his Rabb. Those who adopt such conduct will deserve
				forgiveness and a rich reward in the Hereafter. Reference
				is made to those common truths of daily occurrence to
				which man does not pay much attention. He is told that
				the earth on which he moves about with full satisfaction
				and peace of mind, and from which he obtains his
				sustenance, is subdued for him by Allah. This earth might
				at any time start shaking suddenly so as to cause his
				destruction, or a typhoon might occur, which may
				annihilate him completely. Look at the birds that fly in
				the air: it is Allah Who is sustaining them in the air.
				Then man is reminded: "Look at your own means and
				resources. If Allah wills to inflict you with a scourge,
				none can save you from it; and if Allah wills to close
				the doors of sustenance on you, none can open them for
				you. These things are there to make you aware of the
				truth, but you see them like animals, which are unable to
				draw conclusions from observations, and you do not use
				your sight, hearing and minds which Allah has bestowed on
				you as men. You have to ultimately appear before your
				Rabb. It is not for the Prophet to tell you the exact
				time and date of that event. His only duty is to warn you
				beforehand of its inevitable occurrence."
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally a response is given to what the disbelievers of
				Makkah said against the Prophet (pbuh) and his
				Companions. They cursed the Prophet and prayed for his
				and the believers destruction. To this it has been said:
				"Whether those who call you to the right way are
				destroyed, or shown mercy by Allah, how will their fate
				change your destiny? You should look after yourselves and
				consider who would save you if you were overtaken by the
				scourge of Allah? You regard those who believe in Allah
				and put their trust in Him as the misguided. A time will
				come when it will become evident as to who was really
				misguided."
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, the people are asked this question and
				left to ponder over it, "if the water which has come out
				from the earth at some place in the desert or hill
				country of Arabia and upon which depends your whole
				life's activity, should sink and vanish underground, who,
				besides Allah, can restore this life giving water to
				you?"

				The Holy Prophet is addressed as if to say: "The

				are presenting and the sublime conduct that you practise
				are by themselves sufficient to refute their false
				accusations. Soon they will see as to who was mad and who

				The disbelievers are admonished that well being in the

				what he said was true. 
			</p>

				The whole Surah is meant to answer this question saying:
				"Resurrection, which they desire to be hastened out of

				cause great distress to the culprits. At that time they
				will even be prepared to give away their wives and

				In this Surah, the story of the Prophet Nuh (Noah) is
				told to warn the disbelievers of Makkah: "You, O people
				of Makkah, are adopting towards Muhammad (peace be upon
				him) the same attitude as the people of the Prophet Noah
				had adopted towards him; if you do not change this
				attitude, you too would meet with the same end."
			</p>
			<p>
				This Surah starts with a brief explanation of how the
				Prophet Nuh began his mission and what he preached. Then,
				after suffering hardships and troubles in fulfilling his
				mission for 950 years, the report that he made to his
				Rabb is given in vv. 5-20. In it he states how he had
				been trying to bring his people to the right path and how
				his people had stubbornly opposed him. After this, the
				Prophet Nuh prays to Allah, saying: "These people have
				rejected my invitation: they are blindly following their
				chiefs, who have devised a tremendous plot of deceit and
				cunning. Time now has come when these people should be
				deprived of every grace." This was not an expression of
				impatience by the Prophet Nuh, but when after having
				preached his message under extremely trying circumstances
				for 950 years he became utterly disappointed with his
				people, he formed the opinion that no chance whatever was
				left of their coming to the right path. His opinion fully
				conformed to Allah's own decision.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the concluding verse, the Prophet Nuh's supplication
				that he made to Allah when the torment descended, has
				been recorded. He seeks forgiveness for himself and all
				the believers, and submits to Allah: "Do not leave any of
				the disbelievers alive on the earth for they have become
				utterly devoid of every good; they will not beget any but
				disbelieving and wicked descendents."

				Verses #8-10 indicate that, before the appointment of
				Muhammad (peace be upon him as a Rasool, the jinn had the
				opportunity to eavesdrop in the heavens in order to hear
				news from the unseen. But after the appointment of
				Muhammad (pbuh) they suddenly found that angels had been
				set as guards and meteorites were being shot at them from
				every side, so much so that they could find no place of
				safety from where they could hear the secret news. They
				then started searching for the unusual things that
				occurred on the earth, or were going to occur, because of
				which security measures were tightened up. Probably since
				then, many companies of the jinn must have been moving
				about in search of any unusual occurrence and one of
				them, after having heard the Qur'an from the Prophet
				(pbuh), must have formed the opinion that it was the very
				thing for the sake of which all the gates of the heavens
				had been shut against the jinn.
			</p>
			<p>
				This Surah reflects the impact of The Qur'an on the
				company of the jinn when they heard it and what they said
				to their fellow jinn when they returned to them. Allah,
				in this connection, has not cited their whole
				conversation but only those particular things which were
				worthy of mention. That is why the style is not that of a
				continuous speech but sentences have been cited so as to
				indicate that they said this and that. If one studies
				these sentences spoken by the jinn carefully, one can
				easily understand the real object of the narration of
				this event, of their affirming the faith and mentioning
				this conversation of theirs with their people in the
				Qur'an.
			</p>
			<p>
				The people are admonished: "If you refrain from
				polytheism and firmly follow the way of righteousness,
				you will be blessed; otherwise, if you turn away from the
				admonition sent down by Allah, you will meet with a
				severe punishment." The disbelievers of Makkah are
				reproached: "When the Messenger of Allah calls you
				towards Allah, you surround and mob him from every side,
				whereas the only duty of the Messenger is to convey the
				messages of Allah. He does not claim to have any power to
				bring any gain or cause any harm to the people." The
				disbelievers are further warned: "Today you are trying to
				overpower and suppress the Rasool seeing that he is
				helpless and friendless, but a time will come when you
				will know who in actual fact is helpless and friendless.
				Whether that time is yet far off, or near at hand, the
				Messenger has no knowledge thereof, but it will come to
				pass in any case."
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, the people are told: "The Knower of the
				unseen is Allah Alone. The Rasool receives only that
				knowledge which Allah is pleased to give him. This
				knowledge pertains to matters connected with the
				performance of the duties of Prophethood and it is
				delivered to him in such security that it does not admit
				any external interference whatever.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Reality of Jinn">
			<p>
				Many people have the misunderstanding that the jinn are
				not real, but an ancient superstition and myth. Their
				opinion is not based on the realities and truths about
				the universe and they have no direct knowledge that the
				jinn do not exist nor can they claim to possess any such
				knowledge. They have assumed, without reason and proof,
				that nothing exists in the universe except what they can
				see, whereas the sphere of human perception in accordance
				with the vastness of this great universe is not even
				comparable to a drop of water in the oceans. The person
				who thinks that what he does not see, does not exist, and
				what exists must necessarily be perceived, in fact,
				provides a proof of the narrowness of his own mind. With
				this mode of thought, not to speak of the jinn, man
				cannot even accept and acknowledge any reality which he
				cannot directly experience and observe, thus he cannot
				admit the existence of God, not to say admitting any
				other unseen reality.
			</p>
			<p>
				Those Muslims who have been influenced by such opinions
				have given strange interpretations of the clear
				statements of the Qur'an about the jinn, Iblees and
				Satan. They say that the word jinn does not refer to any
				hidden creature, which may have its own independent
				existence, but it sometimes implies man's own animal
				forces, which have been called Satanic, and it sometimes
				implies savage and wild mountain tribes, and to the
				people who used to listen to the Qur'an secretly. But the
				statements of the Qur'an in this regard are so clear and
				explicit that these interpretations bear no relevance.
				The Qur'an frequently mentions the jinn and the men in a
				manner as to indicate that they are two separate
				creations. For example:
			</p>
			<p>
				Surah Al-A'raf: 12, Al Hijr : 26-27 and Ar-Rahman :
				14-19, expressly state that man was created out of clay
				and jinn out of fire.
			</p>
			<p>
				Surah Al Hijr: 27, states that the jinn had been created
				before man. The same thing is testified by the story of
				Adam and Iblees, which has been cited at seven different
				places in the Qur'an, and at every place it confirms that
				Iblees was already there at the creation of man.
			</p>
			<p>
				Surah Al-K'ahf: 50, states that Iblees was a jinn. Surah
				Al-A'raf: 27, states in clear words that the jinn see
				human beings, but human beings do not see them.
			</p>
			<p>
				Surah Al-Hijr: 16-l8, Surah As-Saffat: 6-10 and Surah
				Al-Mulk: 5, state that the jinn can ascend to the heavens
				but they cannot exceed a certain limit; if they try to
				ascend beyond that limit and try to hear what goes on in
				the heavens, they will not be allowed to do so. If they
				try to eavesdrop they will be driven away by meteorites.
				By this, the belief of the polytheistic Arabs that the
				jinn possess knowledge of the unseen, or have access to
				Divine secrets, has been refuted.
			</p>
			<p>
				Surah Saba: 14 affirms the same facts.
			</p>
			<p>
				Surahs Al-Baqarah: 30-34 and Al-K'ahf: 50 state that
				Allah has entrusted man with the vicegerency of the earth
				and that mankind are superior to the jinn. Although the
				jinn also have been given certain extraordinary powers
				and abilities, an example of which is found in An-Naml
				39, the animals likewise have been given some powers
				greater than man, but these provide no argument that the
				animals are superior to man.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Qur'an also explains that the jinn, like men, are a
				creation and are given the power and authority to choose
				between right and wrong, obedience and disobedience,
				belief and disbelief. This fact has been confirmed by the
				Qur'an in the story of Adam, where Iblees (Satan) refused
				to obey Allah's order to bow down to Adam. A similar
				event where jinn affirm Faith is stated in Surahs
				Al-Ahqaf and Al-Jinn. At various places in the Qur'an, it
				has also been stated that Iblees, at the very creation of
				Adam, had resolved to misguide mankind, and since then,
				the Satanic jinn have been persistently trying to mislead
				man, but they do not have the power to overwhelm him and
				forcibly make him do something. However, they inspire him
				with evil suggestions, beguile him and make evil seem
				good to him. (Examples of this phenomenon are given in
				Surah An-Nisa' 117-120, Al-A'raf: 11-17, Ibrahim: 22,
				Al-Hijr: 30-42, An-Nahl 98-100, Bani Israel 61-65.) The
				Qur'an also states that in the pre Islamic ignorance, the
				polytheistic Arabs regarded the jinn as associates of
				God, worshipped them and thought they had descended from
				God. For reference see Surahs A1-An'am: 100, Saba :
				40-41, As-Saffat: 158.
			</p>
			<p>
				From these details, it becomes clear that the jinn have
				their own existence, are an invisible creature and of an
				entirely different nature. Because of their mysterious
				qualities, ignorant people have formed exaggerated
				notions and concepts about them and their powers, and
				have even worshipped them.

				In the first seven verses, the Prophet (pbuh) has been
				commanded: "Prepare yourself to shoulder the
				responsibilities of the great Mission that has been
				entrusted to you; its practical form is that you should
				rise during the hours of night and stand up in Prayer for
				half the night, or for a little more or less of it.
				Devote yourself exclusively to that God Who is the Owner
				of the whole universe and entrust all your affairs to Him
				with full satisfaction of the heart. Bear with patience
				whatever your opponents may utter against you. Do not be
				intimate with them. Leave their affair to God: He Himself
				will deal with them." The people of Makkah are warned:
				"We have sent a Messenger to you just as We sent a
				Messenger to the Pharaoh. Just consider what fate Pharaoh
				met when he did not accept the invitation of the
				Messenger of Allah. Supposing that you are not punished
				by a torment in this world, how will you save yourselves
				from the punishment for disbelief on the Day of
				Resurrection."
			</p>
			<p>
				The second section, according to a tradition from
				Sayyiduna Sa'id bin Jubair, was sent down ten years
				later, and in it the initial command given in connection
				with the Tahajjud Prayer, in the beginning of the first
				section, was curtailed. The new Command enjoined, "Offer
				as much of the Tahajjud Prayer as you easily can, but
				what the Muslims should particularly mind and attend to
				is the five times obligatory prayer a day:, they should
				establish it regularly and punctually; they should
				discharge their Zakah dues accurately; and they should
				spend their wealth with sincere intentions for the sake
				of Allah.
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, the Muslims are exhorted: "Whatever good
				works you do in the world will not go waste, but they are
				like the provision which a traveller sends up in advance
				to his permanent place of residence. Whatever good you
				send up from the world, you will find it with Allah, and
				the provision thus sent up is much better than what you
				will have to leave behind in the world, and with Allah
				you will also get a much better and richer reward than
				what you have actually sent up before."

				The earliest revelation to the Prophet (pbuh) was the
				first five verses of Surah Al-'Alaq, in which it was
				said: "Read (O Prophet), in the name of your Rabb, Who
				created: created man from a clot of congealed blood.
				Read; and your Rabb is Most Generous, Who taught
				knowledge by the pen, taught man what he did not know."
			</p>
			<p>
				This was his first experience of revelation, therefore,
				in this Message it was not told what great mission he was
				being entrusted with and what duties he had to perform in
				the future. He was only initiated into it and then left
				alone for a while in order to absorb the great strain
				this experience had caused him and to allow him to become
				mentally prepared to receive the revelation and perform
				the prophetic mission in the future. After this
				intermission, when the revelation was resumed, the first
				seven verses of Surah Al-Muddaththir were revealed. In
				these Ayat, he was for the first time commanded to arise
				and warn the people of the consequences of the way of
				life they were following and to proclaim the greatness of
				Allah in a world where others were being magnified
				without any justification. He was given this instruction:
				"The demand of the unique mission that you are to perform
				now, is that your life should be pure in every respect
				and you should carry out the duty of reforming your
				people sincerely, irrespective of any worldly gain."
				Then, in the last sentence, he is exhorted to endure with
				patience, for the sake of his Rabb, all the hardships and
				troubles that he might have to face while performing his
				mission.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the implementation of this Divine Command, when the
				Prophet began to preach Islam and recite the Qur'anic
				Surahs revealed successively, the people of Makkah felt
				alarmed, and it provoked a great storm of opposition and
				hostility. A few months passed in this state until the
				Hajj season approached. The people of Makkah feared that
				if Muhammad (pbuh) started visiting the caravans of the
				pilgrims coming from all over Arabia at their resting
				places reciting the spell binding and unique verses of
				the Qur'an to their assemblies, his message would
				eventually reach every part of Arabia and influence
				countless people. Therefore, the Qureysh chiefs held a
				conference and decided that they would start a propaganda
				campaign against the Prophet (pbuh) among the pilgrims as
				soon as they arrived. After they had agreed on this,
				Walid bin Al-Mughirah said to the assembled people: "If
				you say contradictory things about Muhammad, we all would
				lose our trust among the people. Therefore, let us agree
				upon one opinion, which we should all say without
				dispute. They all requested Walid to come up with some
				statement and he said: "Let me think it over for awhile."
				Then, after prolonged thought and consideration, he said:
				"The nearest thing to the truth is that you tell the
				Arabs that he is a sorcerer, who has brought a message by
				which he separates a man from his father, and from his
				brother, and from his wife and children, and from his
				family." They all agreed on what Walid had proposed.
				Then, in accordance to the scheme, the men of Qureysh
				spread out among the pilgrims of Hajj and warned everyone
				that they should avoid the sorcery of Muhammad through
				which he stirs up division among the families." But the
				plan, which the Qureysh chiefs carried out, yielded
				results contrary to what they had expected and actually
				favored the Prophet and his name became known throughout
				Arabia. (Ibn Hisham, pp. 288-289).
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, this Surah clearly states: "Allah does not
				stand in need of anybody's faith. The Qur'an is an
				admonition that has been presented before the people
				openly; now whoever wants may accept it. Allah has the
				right that the people should fear Him and He Alone has
				the power to forgive the one who adopts piety and God
				consciousness, even though one may have committed many
				acts of disobedience in the past."

				This Surah addresses the deniers of the Hereafter and
				replies are given to each of their doubts and objections.
				Strong arguments are given to prove the possibility,
				occurrence and necessity of the Resurrection and the
				Hereafter, and it also has been pointed out clearly that
				the actual reason of people's denying the Hereafter is
				not that they regard it as impossible rationally, but
				because their selfish motives do not allow them to affirm
				it.
			</p>
			<p>
				After verse 15, the discourse is suddenly interrupted and
				the Prophet (pbuh) is told: "Do not move your tongue
				hastily to remember this Revelation. It is Our
				responsibility to have it remembered and read. Therefore,
				when We are reciting it, listen to its recital carefully.
				Again, it is Our responsibility to explain its meaning."
				Then, from verse 2O onward the same theme which was
				interrupted at verse 15, is resumed. This parenthetical
				passage, according to both the context and the
				traditions, has been interjected here for a reason. That
				is, when the Angel Gabriel was reciting this Surah to the
				Prophet, the Prophet, lest he should forget its words
				later, was repeating them at the same moment. This in
				fact happened at the time when the coming down and
				receipt of Revelation was yet a new experience for him
				and he was not yet fully used to receiving it calmly.
				There are two other instances also of this in the Qur'an.
				First, in Surah TuaHa, the Prophet (pbuh) was told: "And
				see that you do not hasten to recite the Qur'an before
				its revelation is completed to you." (v. 114). Then, in
				Surah Al-A'la, it has been said: "We shall enable you to
				recite, then you shall never forget." (v. 6). Later, when
				the Prophet became fully used to receiving the Revelation
				properly, there remained no need to give him such
				instruction. That is why, except for these three
				instances, there are no other instructions like this in
				the Qur'an.

				In this Surah, man is reminded that there was a time when
				he was nothing; then, a humble beginning of him was made
				with a mixed drop of sperm and ovum of which even his
				mother was not aware; even she did not know that he had
				been conceived nor anyone else seeing the microscopic
				cell could say that it was a man, who in the future would
				become the best of creation on the earth. After this, man
				has been warned: "Beginning your creation in this way, We
				have developed and shaped you into what you are today in
				order to test and try you in the world. That is why,
				unlike other creatures, you were made intelligent and
				sensible and were shown both the way of gratitude and the
				way of ingratitude clearly. So that you may prove in this
				test; whether you are a grateful servant or an
				unbelieving, Ungrateful wretch!" Then, just in one
				sentence, it has been stated decisively what the fate
				will be in the Hereafter for those who emerged as
				unbelievers from this test.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the first section, the blessings with which those who
				do full justice by serving in the world, will be favored.
				Not only have their best rewards been mentioned, but they
				have also been told briefly what the acts on the basis of
				which they would become worthy of those rewards are.
				After introducing the fundamental beliefs of Islam, those
				moral qualities and virtuous acts which are praiseworthy
				according to Islam, have been mentioned, and also those
				evils of deed which Islam strives to cleanse from human
				life. These two things are not mentioned with a view to
				show what good or evil result is entailed by them in the
				transitory life of this world, but they have been
				mentioned only to point out what enduring results they
				will produce in the eternal and everlasting life of the
				Hereafter, irrespective of whether an evil quality may
				prove useful or a good quality may prove harmful during
				their life in the world.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the second section, addressing the Prophet (pbuh),
				three things are stated:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					It is in fact We, Ourself are revealing this
					Qur'an piecemeal to you, and this is intended to
					inform the disbelievers, not you, that the Qur'an
					is not being fabricated by Muhammad (pbuh), but
					it is We, Who are revealing it, and it is Our Own
					wisdom which requires that We should reveal it
					piece by piece and not all at once.
				</li>
				<li>
					No matter how long it may take for the decree of
					your Lord to be enforced, and no matter what
					afflictions may befall you in the meantime, in
					any case, you should continue to perform your

					the pressure tactics of any of these wicked and
					unbelieving people.

					and spend your nights in the worship of Allah,
					for it is these things which sustain and
					strengthen those who call to Allah in the face of

			</ol>
			<p>
				In conclusion, it is said: "This Qur'an is an admonition;
				whoever wills may accept it and take the path to his
				Rabb. But man's own will and desire is not everything in
				the world. No one's will and desire can be fulfilled
				unless Allah (also) so wills. And Allah's willing is not
				haphazard; whatever He wills, He wills it on the basis of
				His knowledge and wisdom. He admits into His mercy
				whomever He regards as worthy of His mercy on the basis
				of His knowledge and wisdom, and He has prepared a
				painful torment for those who are unjust and wicked."

				This Surah was revealed in the early period during the

				Al-Qiyamah and Ad-Dahr, and the two Surahs following it,
				namely An-Naba and An-Nazi'at, it becomes obvious that
				all these Surahs are the revelations of the same period,
				and they deal with one and the same theme, which has been
				impressed on the people of Makkah in different ways.

		<section heading="Theme">
			<p>
				The theme of this Surah is to affirm the Resurrection and
				Hereafter and to warn the people of the consequences
				which will ultimately follow either the denial or the
				affirmation of these truths.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the first seven verses, the system of winds is
				presented as an evidence of the truth that the
				Resurrection which is being foretold by the Qur'an and
				the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) must come to pass. The power
				of All-Mighty Allah Who has established this wonderful
				system on the earth, is not helpless in bringing about
				the Resurrection and the express wisdom which underlies
				this system bears full evidence that the Hereafter must
				appear, for no act of an All- Wise Creator is vain and
				purposeless, and if there was no Hereafter, it would mean
				that of this life is useless and purposeless.
			</p>
			<p>
				In vv. 16-28 arguments are given for the occurrence and
				necessity of the Resurrection and Hereafter. Man's own
				history, his own birth, and the structure of the earth on
				which he lives, bears the testimony that the coming of
				the Resurrection and the establishment of the Hereafter
				are possible as well as the demand of Allah Almighty's
				wisdom. History tells us that the nations which denied
				the Hereafter ultimately became corrupted and met with
				destruction. This means that the Hereafter is a truth
				which, if denied and contradicted by a nation through its
				conduct and attitude, will cause it to meet the same fate
				as would be a blind man who rushes headlong into an
				approaching train. It also means that in the Kingdom of
				the universe, not only physical laws are at work, but
				also moral laws, under which the process of retribution
				is operating. But since in the present life of the world
				retribution is not taking place in its complete and
				perfect form, the moral law of the universe necessarily
				demands that there should come a time when it should take
				its full course, and all those good works and evil deeds,
				which could not be rewarded here, or which escaped their
				due punishment, should be fully rewarded and punished.
				For this purpose, it is inevitable that there should be a
				second life after death. If man only considers how he
				takes his birth in the world, his intellect, provided it
				is sound intellect, cannot deny that Allah, Who began his
				creation from an insignificant sperm drop and developed
				him into a perfect human being, is able to create the
				same human being once again.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the end, the deniers of the Hereafter and those who
				turn away from Allah's worship, are warned: "Enjoy your
				short-lived worldly pleasure as you may, but your end
				will ultimately be disastrous." The discourse concludes
				with the assertion that the one who fails to obtain
				guidance from the Qur'an, can have no other source of
				Guidance.

		<section heading="Theme">
			<p>
				Its theme is to affirm the resurrection and hereafter,
				and to warn the people of the consequences of
				disbelieving it. When the Prophet (pbuh) first started to
				preach Islam at Makkah, his message consisted of three
				elements:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					That none be held as an associate with Allah in
					Godhead.
				</li>
				<li>
					That Allah had appointed him as His Messenger.
				</li>
				<li>
					This world will come to an end one day and then
					another world will be established when all the
					former and the latter generations will be
					resurrected with the same bodies in which they
					lived and worked in the world; then they will be
					called to account for their beliefs and deeds and
					those who emerge as believing and righteous in
					this accountability will go to paradise and those
					who are proved to be disbelieving and wicked will
					live in hell for ever.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Of these, the first item was highly unpleasant for the
				people of Makkah, they were not disbelievers in the
				existence of Allah. They believed in His Being the
				Supreme Sustainer, Creator and Providence and also
				admitted that all those beings whom they regarded as
				their deities, were themselves Allah's creatures.
				Therefore, in this regard the only thing they disputed
				was whether they had any share in the attributes and
				powers of Divinity and in the Divine Being itself or not.
			</p>
			<p>
				As for the second item, the people of Makkah were not
				prepared to accept it. However, what they could not
				possibly deny was that during the 40 year life the
				Prophet (pbuh) had lived amongst them before his claim to
				Prophethood, they had never found him lying or deceitful
				or one who would adopt unlawful methods for selfish ends.
			</p>
			<p>
				As for the third thing, resurrection, they mocked it most
				and expressed unusual wonder at it, and regarding it as
				remote from reason and impossible. They talked about it
				as incredible, even inconceivable, in their assemblies.
				Therefore, reference is made to the common talk and the
				doubts that were being expressed in every street of
				Makkah and in every assembly of the people on hearing the
				news about Resurrection. Then, the deniers have been
				asked: "Don't you see this earth which We have spread as
				a carpet for you? Don't you see the high mountains which
				we have so firmly placed in the earth? Don't you consider
				your own selves how We have created you as pairs of men
				and women? Don't you consider your sleep by which We make
				you seek a few hours rest after every few hours labor and
				toil so as to keep you fit for work in the world? Don't
				you see the alternation of the night and day which We are
				so regularly perpetuating precisely according to your
				needs and requirements? Don't you see the strongly
				fortified system of the heavens above you? Don't you see
				the sun by means of which you are receiving your light
				and heat? Don't you see the rains which fall from the
				clouds and help produce corn and vegetables and gardens?
				Do these things only tell you that the power of the
				Almighty Being Who has created them, will be unable to
				bring about Resurrection and establish the Next World?
				Then, from the supreme wisdom which is clearly working in
				this world around you, do you only understand that
				although each function of it is for a purpose, life is
				yet meaningless? Nothing could be more absurd and
				meaningless, that man after being granted vast powers of
				appropriation in this world be let off without any
				accountability. He should neither be rewarded for
				satisfactory work, nor punished for unsatisfactory
				performance.
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, the Divine Court in the Hereafter has been
				depicted, making it plain that there will be no question
				of somebody's being adamant in the matter of getting his
				followers and associates forgiven. None will speak
				without leave and leave for intercession will be given
				only for those who had acknowledged the Truth in the
				world; rebels of God and rejectors of the Truth will
				deserve no intercession at all.

				Arguments are then given in support of the Hereafter and

				special purpose. Pointing to this, the question has been
				left to the intellect of man for pondering and to form an
				opinion of whether calling man to account for his sins
				after delegating authority and responsibility to him
				would be in keeping with the demands of a wise system. Or

				The error in the method that the Prophet adopted at the
				start of his mission is also pointed out. His treating of
				the blind man with neglect and disregard, and
				consequently devoting all of his attention to the Qureysh
				chiefs was not because he regarded the rich as noble and
				a poor blind man as contemptible. Naturally, when a
				caller to the Truth embarks on the mission of conveying
				his message to people, he wants the most influential
				people of society to accept the message so his task
				becomes easier. Almost the same attitude the Prophet
				(upon whom be peace) had adopted in the beginning, an
				attitude of sincerity and a desire to promote his mission
				and not out of respect for the rich people and hatred for
				the poor. But Allah made him realize the correct method
				of extending invitation to Islam and his mission's point
				of view: every man, who was a seeker of the truth, was
				important, even if he was weak, or poor, and every man,
				who was heedless to the truth, was unimportant, even if
				he occupied a high position in society.

				The theme of this Surah is also the Hereafter. In the
				first six verses, the people are taken to task for the
				evil practice prevalent in their commercial dealings.
				When they received their due from others, they demanded
				that it be given in full, but when they had to measure or
				weigh for others, they would give less than what was due.
				Taking this one evil as an example out of countless evils
				prevalent in society, it is said that it is an inevitable
				result of the heedlessness of the Hereafter. Unless the
				people realized that one Day they would have to appear
				before God and account for each single act they performed
				in the world, it was not possible that they would adopt
				piety and righteousness in their daily affairs. Even if a
				person might practise honesty in some of his less
				important dealings in view of "honesty is the best
				policy", he would never practise honesty on occasions
				when dishonesty would seem to be "the best policy". Man
				can develop a true and enduring honest nature only when
				he fears God and sincerely believes in the Hereafter, for
				then he would regard honesty not merely as "a policy" but
				as "a duty" and obligation, and his being consistent in
				it, would not be dependent on its being useful or useless
				in the world.
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, the believers are consoled, and the
				disbelievers warned that the people who are disgracing
				and humiliating the believers today, are culprits who, on
				the Resurrection Day will meet with a most evil end in
				consequence of their conduct, and the believers will feel
				comforted when they will see their fate.

				This Surah was revealed in Makkah during the period when
				persecution of the Muslims was at its peak and the
				disbelievers of Makkah were trying their utmost by
				tyranny and coercion to turn away the new converts from
				Islam.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section heading="Theme">
			<p>
				This Surah warns the disbelievers of the evil
				consequences of persecution and tyranny and consoles the
				believers that if they remain firm and steadfast against
				tyranny and coercion, they will be rewarded for it, and
				Allah Himself will avenge their persecutors. In this
				connection, the story of the people of the ditch (Ashab
				al-Ukhdud), who had burnt the believers to death by
				casting them into pits full of fire is related. By means
				of this story the believers and the disbelievers have
				been taught a few lessons:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					That just as the people of the ditch became
					worthy of Allah's curse and punishment, the
					chiefs of Makkah are also becoming worthy of it.
				</li>
				<li>
					That just as the believers at that time had
					willingly accepted to sacrifice their lives by
					being burnt to death in the pits of fire instead
					of turning away from their faith, so also should
					the believers now endure every persecution and
					never give up faith.
				</li>
				<li>
					That Allah, to Whom belongs the Kingdom of the
					earth and heavens, is Praiseworthy and is
					watching what the two groups are striving for.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Therefore, the disbelievers will not only be punished in
				Hell for their disbelief but, in addition to that, they
				also will suffer punishment by fire as a fit recompense
				for their tyranny and cruelty. The believers who are firm
				in their belief and do good deeds will go to paradise.
				This indeed is the supreme success. Then the disbelievers
				are warned that Allah's grip is very severe. If they are
				proud of the strength of their hosts, they should know
				that the hosts of Pharaoh and Thamud were even stronger
				and more numerous. Therefore, they should learn a lesson
				from the fate these people of the past met. No one can
				escape Allah's jurisdiction and the Qur'an that they are
				belying is unchangeable: it is inscribed in the Preserved
				Tablet, which cannot be destroyed in any way.

			<p>
				The stars of the heavens are cited as an evidence that
				there is nothing in the universe that may continue to
				exist and survive without guardian over it. Then man is
				asked to consider his own self as far as how he has been
				brought into existence from a mere sperm drop and shaped
				into a living human being. Then it is said that God, Who
				brought him into existence, certainly has the power to
				create him once again in order to scrutinize all of the
				secrets of man which remained hidden in the world. At
				that time, man will neither be able to escape the
				consequences of his deeds by his own power, nor will
				anyone else come to his rescue.
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, it is pointed out that just as the falling
				of rain from the sky and the sprouting of plants and
				crops from the earth is not child's play, but a serious
				task, so also are the truths expressed in the Qur'an no
				jest, but a firm and unchangeable reality. The
				disbelievers think that their plans and devices will
				defeat the invitation of the Qur'an, but they do not know
				that Allah too is devising a plan which will void all
				their scheming and planning. Then a word of consolation
				is provided to the Prophet (pbuh) and a warning to the
				disbelievers that very soon they will themselves realize
				whether they have been able to defeat the Qur'an by their
				schemes or whether the Qur'an has dominated them in the
				very place where they are exerting their utmost to defeat
				it.

				by any name which might reflect a deficiency, fault,
				weakness, or likeness with created beings.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, the Prophet (pbuh) is told: "You are not
				responsible to bring everyone on to the right path; your
				only duty is to convey the message, and the simplest way
				of conveying the message is to admonish him who is
				inclined to listen to the admonition and accept it, and
				the one who is not inclined to it, should not be pursued.
				The one who fears the evil consequences of deviation and
				falsehood, will listen to the truth and accept it, and
				the wretched one who avoids listening to and accepting
				it, will himself see his evil end."

			<p>
				In conclusion, it is said that success is only for those
				who adopt purity of belief, morals and deed, and remember
				the name of their Lord and perform the Prayer. On the
				contrary however, most people are wholly lost in seeking
				the ease, benefits and pleasures of this worldly life,
				instead of endeavoring for their well being in the
				hereafter. The world is transitory and the Hereafter
				everlasting, and the blessings of the Hereafter are far
				better than the blessings of this world. This truth has

				being? How they were endowed precisely with the same

				how the earth was spread beneath them? Has all this come
				about without the skill and craftsmanship of an
				All-Powerful, All Wise Designer? If they acknowledge that

				has been asked: "Even after witnessing this wise system
				established by God, do you still need any other evidence
				to show that it is not beyond the power of that God Who
				has brought about this system to establish the
				Hereafter?" Reasoning is then given from man's own
				history. The evil end of 'Ad, Thamud and Pharaoh are

				This Surah compressed a vast subject into a few brief
				sentences. It is a miracle of the Qur'an that a complete
				ideology of life which could hardly be explained in a
				thick volume has been abridged most effectively in the
				brief sentences of this short Surah. Its theme is to
				explain the true position of man in the world and of the
				world in relation to man and tell that Allah has shown
				man both the highways of good and evil. Allah has also
				provided for him the means to judge, see and follow them.
				Now it rests upon man's own effort and judgement whether
				he chooses the path of virtue and reaches felicity or
				adopts the path of evil and meets with doom.

				After this, man's misunderstanding that he is all there

					each other and contradictory in their effects and
					results, so are good and evil different from each

				placed in human nature is, by itself, not enough for the
				guidance of man; rather on account of his failure to
				understand it, man has invented wrong criteria, and
				theories of good and evil, and is going astray. The

				This Surah so closely resembles that of Surah Ash-Shams
				that each Surah seems to be an explanation of the other.
				It is one and the same thing which has been explained in
				Surah Ash-Shams in one way and in this Surah in another.
				This indicates that both these Surahs were sent down in

				This Surah identifies two different ways of life and
				explains the contrast between their ultimate ends and
				results. The first way is of the one who spends his
				wealth, adopts God-consciousness and piety, and
				acknowledges the good as good. The second way is of the
				one who is a miser, lacks care for God's pleasure or
				displeasure, and repudiates what is good and right. It is
				stated that these two modes of action, which are clearly
				opposite to each other, cannot be equal and alike in
				respect of their results. Just as they are divergent in
				their nature, so are they divergent in their results.
				After this the following three realities are stated
				briefly:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					That Allah has not left man uninformed in the
					examination hall of the world, but has taken on
					Himself the responsibility to tell him which one
					is the straight and right way out of the
					different ways of life. There is no need to point
					out that by sending His Rasool and His Book He
					has fulfilled His responsibility. 
				</li>
				<li>
					That the Master of both the world and the
					Hereafter is Allah Alone. If you seek the world,
					it is He Who will give it, and if you seek the
					Hereafter, again it is He Who will give it. Now,
					it is for you to decide what you should seek from
					Him. 
				</li>
				<li>
					That the wretched one who rejects good, which is
					being presented through the Rasool and the Book,
					and turns away from it, will have a blazing fire
					ready for him. As for the God fearing person who
					spends his wealth in a good cause, without any
					selfish motive and only for the sake of his
					Rabb's pleasure, his Rabb will be pleased with
					him and will bless him with so much that he will
					be well pleased with Him.

				This Surah was revealed during the early period at Makkah
				when the revelations were suspended for a time in the
				initial stage of Prophethood due to the fact that
				Muhammad (pbuh) was not yet accustomed to bearing the
				intensity of revelation.

				Good news to the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) that the later
				period will be better for him than the earlier.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Theme">
			<p>
				The theme of this Surah is to console the Prophet (pbuh)
				and its object is to remove his anxiety and distress,
				which was caused by the suspension of revelation. The
				Prophet is reassured: "Your Rabb has not at all forsaken
				you, nor is he displeased with you." Then, he is given
				the good news that the hardships that he was experiencing
				in the initial stage of his mission will not last long
				and the later period of life for him will be better than
				the former period. Before long, Allah will bless him so
				abundantly that he will be well pleased. This is one of
				the express prophecies of the Qur'an, which proved
				literally true later on. When this prophecy was made,
				there seemed not to be the remotest chance that the
				helpless and powerless man who had come out to wage a war
				against ignorance and paganism would ever achieve such
				wonderful success.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Prophet (pbuh) is then told: "What made you think
				that your Rabb has forsaken you, and that We are
				displeased with you? Whereas the fact is that We have
				been good to you with kindness after kindness ever since
				the day of your birth. You were born an orphan, We made
				the best arrangement for your upbringing and care: you
				were unaware of the Way, We showed you the Way; you were
				indigent, We made you rich. All this shows that you have
				been favored by Us from the very beginning and Our grace
				and bounty has been constantly focussed on you." These
				are the similar words which Allah said to console Prophet
				Musa (Moses) when he was sent to Pharaoh as described in
				Surah TuaHa vv. 37-42: "We have been looking after you
				with kindness ever since your birth; therefore, you
				should be satisfied that you will not be left alone in
				this dreadful mission. Our bounty will constantly be with
				you."

				This Surah is also to console and encourage the Prophet
				(pbuh). He never had to encounter the conditions which he
				suddenly had to encounter after embarking on his mission
				of inviting people to Islam. This was by itself a great
				revolution in his life. When he started preaching the
				message of Islam, the same society which had esteemed him
				with unique honor, turned hostile to him. The same
				relatives and friends, the same clansmen and neighbors,
				who used to treat him with the highest respect, began to
				shower him with abuse and insult. No one in Makkah was
				prepared to listen to him; he was being ridiculed and
				mocked in the street and on the road; and at every step
				he had to face new difficulties. Although he gradually
				became accustomed to the hardships, even as they became
				more severe, yet the initial stage was very discouraging
				for him. That is why Surah Ad-Duha was sent down first to
				console him, and then this Surah.
			</p>
			<p>
				This Surah states that Allah has bestowed three major
				favors on the Prophet: the first is the blessing of Sharh
				Sadr (opening up of the breast), the second by removing
				from him the heavy burden that was weighing down his back
				before the call, and the third by exalting his renown the
				like of which has never been granted to any man before.
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, the Prophet is instructed: "You can
				develop the power to bear and resist the hardships of the
				initial stage only by one means, and it is this: `When
				you are free from your occupations, you should devote
				yourself to the labor and toil of worship, and turn all
				your attention exclusively to your Rabb."

				There are two different views relating to this Surah:
				first that it is a Makki Surah, and second that it is
				Madani Surah. The majority of scholars regard it as a

			<p>
				The theme of this Surah is concerning the rewards and
				punishments in the Hereafter. For this purpose, first
				swearing an oath by the two sacred places (Mount of Tur
				and Makkah where Allah revealed His message to the
				Prophet Moses and the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon
				them) it is stated that Allah has created man in the most
				excellent of moulds. This signifies that man has been
				blessed with such excellent capabilities that he can
				attain the highest position which has not been attained
				by any other creature. Then, it is pointed out that there
				are two kinds of men:
			</p>
			<p>
				Those who inspite of having been created in the finest of
				moulds, become inclined to evil and their moral
				degeneration causes them to be reduced to the lowest of
				the low.
			</p>
			<p>
				Those, who by adopting the way of faith and
				righteousness, remain secure from degeneration and are
				consistent with the noble position, which is the
				necessary demand of their having been created in the best
				of moulds.
			</p>
			<p>
				The existence among mankind of both these kinds is a
				factual thing which no one can deny. It is being observed
				and experienced in society everywhere at all times.
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, this reality is used as an argument to
				prove that when among the people there exist two separate
				and quite distinct kinds, how can one deny the judgement
				and retribution for deeds. If the morally degraded people
				are not punished and the morally pure people are not
				rewarded (both end in the dust alike), it would mean that
				there is no justice in the Kingdom of God, whereas human
				nature and common sense demands that a judge should do
				justice. How then can one conceive that Allah, Who is the
				most just of all judges, would not be just?

			<p>
				When the Prophet (pbuh) experienced this extraordinary
				event of receiving the first revelation, he returned home
				to Sayyidah Khadijah trembling with fear, and said to
				her: "Cover me, cover me," and he was covered. When
				terror left him, he said: "O Khadijah, what has happened
				to me?" Then he narrated to her whatever had happened,
				and said: "I fear for my life." She took him to Waraqah
				bin Naufal, who had become a Christian in pre-Islamic
				days, transcribed the Gospel in Arabic and Hebrew, and
				had become blind through old age. Waraqah said: "This is
				the same Namus (the Angel assigned to bring revelations)
				which Allah had sent down to Moses (pbuh). Would that I
				were a young man during your Prophethood! Would that I
				were alive when your tribe would expel you!" The Holy
				Prophet said: "Will they expel me?" Waraqah said: "Yes,
				never has it so happened that a person brought what you
				have brought and was not treated as an enemy. If I live
				till then I will help you with all the power at my
				command." But not very long after this Waraqah died.
			</p>
			<p>
				This narrative is explicit that when Waraqa bin Naufal,
				who was a Christian, heard the Prophet's experience, he
				did not regard it as an evil suggestion. This meant that
				even according to him, the Prophet was such a sublime
				person that there was nothing surprising in his being
				elevated to the office of Prophethood.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second part of this Surah vv. 6-19 was revealed when
				the Prophet began to perform his prayer in the Islamic
				way. The other people were watching it with curiosity,
				but Abu Jahl in his arrogance and pride threatened the
				Prophet and forbade him to worship in that way in the
				Ka'bah.

			<p>
				The theme of this Surah is to acquaint man with the
				value, worth and importance of the Qur'an. Being placed
				just after Surah Al-'Alaq in the arrangement of the
				Qur'an by itself explains that in the Holy Book, the
				revelation of which began with the first five verses of
				Surah Al-'Alaq, was sent down in a destiny-making night,
				which is also called the Night of Power. It is a glorious
				Book and its revelation for mankind is full of blessings.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Night of Qadr (destiny) has two meanings, both are
				implied here. First, it is the night during which
				destinies are decided. The revelation of this Book in
				this night is not merely the revelation of a book, but an
				event which will change the destiny of the entire world.
				The other meaning is that this is a night of unique
				honor, dignity and glory; so much so that it is better
				than a thousand months. Thus, the disbelievers of Makkah
				have been warned: "You, on account of your ignorance,
				regard this Book, which Muhammad (pbuh) has presented, as
				a calamity for yourselves and complain that a disaster
				has befallen you, whereas the night in which it was
				decreed to be sent down was such a blessed night worth;
				more than a thousand months. In other words, a task was
				accomplished in it for the well-being of mankind which
				had not been accomplished during one thousand months of
				human history.
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, it is stated that in this night, the
				angels along with angel Gabriel, will descend with every
				decree by the leave of their Rabb. There will be peace
				from evening till morning; that is, there is no
				interference of evil in it, for all decrees of Allah are
				intended to promote good.

				In this Surah, the need of sending a Rasool is explained,
				then the errors of the followers of the earlier Books are
				pointed out. The cause of their straying into different
				creeds was not that Allah had not provided any guidance
				to them, but that they strayed only after a clear
				statement of the True religion had come to them. From
				this, it automatically follows that they themselves were
				responsible for their error and deviation. If after the
				coming of the clear statement through Prophet Muhammad
				(pbuh they continued to stray, their responsibility would
				further increase.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Prophets who came from Allah and the Books sent down
				by Him, did not enjoin anything but that the way of
				sincere and true service to Allah be adopted; apart from
				all other ways, no one else's worship, service or
				obedience be mixed with His; the Salah be established and
				the Zakah be paid. This has always been the true
				religion. From this, it also automatically follows that
				the followers of the earlier scriptures, straying from
				this true religion, have added extraneous things to it,
				which are false, and Allah's Rasool has come to invite
				them back to the same original faith.
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, it is pointed out that the followers of
				the earlier Books and the idol worshippers who would
				refuse to acknowledge this Message are the worst of all
				creatures. Their punishment will be an everlasting hell;
				and the people who would believe and act righteously are
				the best of all creatures. Their reward will be an
				eternal paradise wherein they will live forever. Allah

				The object of this Surah is to make people realize how

				heedless of it, and also to warn them that in the
				Hereafter not only their visible and apparent deeds, but
				even the secrets hidden in their hearts too will be
				subjected to scrutiny. For this purpose, the general
				chaos and confusion prevailing in Arabia: bloodshed,
				looting and plundering on every side; tribes subjecting
				other tribes to raids, no one could have peaceful sleep
				at night out of fear that some enemy tribe might raid his
				settlement early in the morning, is pointed out. Every
				Arab was fully conscious of this state of affairs and
				realized that it was wrong. Although the plundered
				bemoaned his miserable, helpless state and the plunderer
				rejoiced when the plunderer himself was plundered, he too
				realized how abject was the condition in which the whole
				nation was involved. Referring to this very state of
				affairs, it is said: all this is happening because the
				people do not know their life after death and their
				accountability before Allah.

				Then an example of stallions (horses used in war) is

				on his command while man is ungrateful to Allah even
				though He has given him life, all faculties, food and
				other provisions. This example shows that an ungrateful
				person is worse than an animal. Such a person is so
				blinded by the love of worldly wealth that he tries to
				obtain it by every means, however impure and filthy it
				may be. He would never have behaved so had he known the
				time when the dead would be raised from their graves and
				when the intentions and motives with which they had done
				all sorts of deeds in the world would be exposed and
				brought out before everyone to see by their Lord and

				This Surah condemns the evils which were prevalent among

				days. After stating this kind of ugly character, the

				Both of these things (i. e. the character and ones fate

				If this Surah is read in the sequence of the Surahs
				beginning with Az-Zilzal, one can fully understand the
				fundamental beliefs of Islam. In Surah Az-Zilzal, it was
				said that in the Hereafter, man's full record will be
				placed before him and not an atom's weight of good or
				evil done by him in the world will have been left
				unrecorded. In Surah Al-'Adiyat, attention was drawn to
				the plunder, loot, bloodshed and vandalism, prevailing in
				Arabia before Islam; then making the people realize, that
				the way the powers given by God were being abused, was
				indeed an expression of sheer ingratitude to Him and
				deserves punishment. In Surah Al-Qariah, after depicting
				the Resurrection, the people were warned that in the
				Hereafter, a man's good or evil end will be dependent on
				whether the scale of his good deeds was heavier, or the
				scale of his evil deeds was heavier. In Surah At-
				Takathur the people were taken to task for their
				materialistic mentality because of which, they remained
				occupied in seeking increase in worldly benefits,
				pleasures, comforts and position. They were warned that
				they would have to render an account to their Rabb and
				Sustainer as to how they obtained it and how they used
				it. In Surah Al-'Asr, it was declared that each member,
				each group and each community of mankind, even the entire
				world of humanity, was in manifest loss if its members
				were devoid of faith, righteous deeds and the practice of
				exhorting others to truth and patience. Immediately after
				this comes Surah Al-Humazah, in which, after presenting a
				specimen of leadership of the pre-Islamic age of
				ignorance, the people are asked the question: "What
				should such character deserve, if not loss and
				perdition?"

			<p>
				In this Surah, Allah's punishment which was inflicted on
				the people of the elephant is referred to and described
				very briefly because it was an event of recent
				occurrence, and everyone in Makkah and Arabia was fully
				aware of it. That's why the Arabs believed that the
				Ka'bah was protected in this invasion, not by any god or
				goddess, but by Allah Almighty Himself. Then Allah Alone
				was invoked by the Qureysh chiefs for help, and for quite
				a few years the people of Qureysh, having been impressed
				by this event, had worshipped none but Allah. Therefore,
				there was no need to mention the details in Surah
				Al-Feel, but only a reference to it was enough.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="History of attack on Ka'bah">
			<p>
				According to Arab historians, the Abyssinian army that
				invaded Yaman had two commanders, Aryat and Abrahah.
				Aryat was killed in an encounter, and Abrahah took
				control of the country; then somehow he persuaded the
				Abyssinian king to appoint him his viceroy over Yaman.
				This man was the slave of a Greek merchant of the
				Abyssinian seaport of Adolis, who, by clever diplomacy,
				had come to wield great influence in the Abyssinian army
				occupying Yaman. The troops sent by the Negus (king of
				Abyssinia) to punish him either warned him or were
				defeated by him. Subsequently, after the death of the
				king, his successor was reconciled to accept him as his
				vicegerent of Yaman. Through passage of time, he became
				an independent ruler of Yaman. He acknowledged the
				sovereignty of the Negus only in name and described
				himself as his deputy.
			</p>
			<p>
				After stabilizing his rule in Yaman, Abrahah turned his
				attention to the objective which from the very beginning
				of this campaign had been before the Byzantine empire and
				its allies, the Abyssinian Christians. This was to spread
				Christianity in Arabia and to capture the trade that was
				carried out through the Arabs between the eastern lands
				and the Byzantine dominions. The need for this increased
				because the Byzantine struggle for power against the
				Sasanian empire of Iran had blocked all the routes of the
				Byzantine trade with the East.
			</p>
			<p>
				To achieve this objective, Abrahah built in Sana, the
				capital of Yaman, a magnificent cathedral called by the
				Arabian historians Al-Qalis. After completing the
				building, he wrote to king Negus, saying: "I shall not
				rest until I have diverted the Arabs pilgrimage to it.
				So, in 570 or 571 A. D., he took 60,000 troops and 13
				elephants (according to another tradition, 9 elephants)
				and set off for Makkah. According to Muhammad bin Ishaq,
				when he was within three miles of Makkah at a place
				called 'al- Mughammas,' Abrahah sent his vanguard forward
				and they brought him the plunder of the people of Tihamah
				and Qureysh, which included two hundred camels of Abdul
				Muttalib, the grandfather of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh).
				Then, he sent an envoy of his to Makkah with the message
				that he had not come to fight the people of Makkah, but
				only to destroy the House (i. e. the Ka'bah). If they
				offered no resistance, there would be no cause for
				bloodshed. Abrahah also instructed his envoy that if the
				people of Makkah wanted to negotiate, he should bring
				their leader to him. The leader of Makkah at that time
				was Abdul Muttalib. The envoy went to him and delivered
				Abrahah's message. Abdul Muttalib replied: "We have no
				power to fight Abrahah. This is Allah's House. If He
				wills, He will save His House." The envoy asked him to go
				with him to Abrahah. He agreed and accompanied him to the
				king. Abdul Muttalib was such a dignified and handsome
				man, that when Abrahah saw him he was much impressed; he
				got off his throne and sat beside him on the carpet. Then
				he asked him what he wanted. Abdul Muttalib replied that
				he wanted the king to return his camels which he had
				taken. Abrahah said: "I was much impressed when I saw
				you, but your reply has brought you down in my eyes; you
				only demand your camels, but you say nothing about this
				House which is your sanctuary and the sanctuary of your
				forefathers." He replied: "I am the owner of my camels
				and am requesting you to return them. As for the House,
				it has its own Owner; He will defend it." When Abrahah
				said that He would not be able to defend it against him,
				Abdul Muttalib said that it rested between Him (Allah)
				and him (Abrahah). With this, Abdul Muttalib left Abrahah
				who returned his camels to him.
			</p>
			<p>
				One thing which becomes evident from this tradition is
				that the tribes living in and around Makkah did not have
				the power to fight such a big force and save the Ka'bah.
				Therefore, obviously, the Qureysh did not try to put up
				any resistance. The Qureysh on the occasion of the Battle
				of the Trench (Ahzab) had hardly been able to muster ten
				to twelve thousand men in spite of the alliance with the
				pagan and Jewish tribes; they could not have resisted an
				army of 60,000 strong. Muhammad bin Ishaq says that after
				returning from the camp of Abrahah, Abdul Muttalib
				ordered the Qureysh to withdraw from the city and go to
				the mountains along with their families for fear of a
				general massacre. Then, he went to the Ka'bah along with
				some chiefs of the Qureysh and taking hold of the iron
				ring of the door, prayed to Allah Almighty. Ibn Hisham,
				in his book 'Life of the Prophet,' has cited some verses
				from Abdul Muttalib:
			</p>
			<p>
				"O God, a man protects his house, so protect Your House;
				Let not their cross and their craft tomorrow overcome
				Your craft. If You will to leave them and our Qiblah to
				themselves, You may do as You please. My Lord, I do not
				cherish any hope from anyone against them except You. O
				my Lord, protect Your House from them. The enemy of this
				House is Your enemy. Stop them from destroying Your
				settlement."
			</p>
			<p>
				After making these supplications Abdul Muttalib and his
				companions also went off to the mountains. The next
				morning Abrahah prepared to enter Makkah, but his special
				elephant, Mahmud, which was in the forefront, knelt down.
				It was beaten with iron bars, goaded, but it would not
				get up. When they made it face south, north, or east, it
				would immediately start off, but as soon as they directed
				it towards Makkah, it knelt down. In the meantime swarms
				of birds appeared carrying stones in their beaks and
				claws and showered these on the troops. Whoever was hit
				would start disintegrating. Ibn 'Abbas says that whoever
				was struck by a pebble, would start scratching his body
				resulting in breaking of the skin and falling off of the
				flesh. In another tradition Ibn 'Abbas says that the
				flesh and blood flowed like water and bones in the body
				became visible. The same thing happened with Abrahah too.
				Nufail bin Habib, whom they had brought as guide from the
				country of Khatham, was searched out and asked to guide
				them back to Yaman, but he refused and said: "Now where
				can one flee when God pursues? The split nose (Abrahah)
				is the conquered; not the conqueror."
			</p>
			<p>
				According to Sayyidah Umme Hani and Sayyiduna Zubair bin
				al-Awwam, the Prophet (pbuh) said: "The Qureysh did not
				worship anyone but Allah, the One and Only, for ten
				years. The Arabs describe the year in which this event
				took place as Am al-Feel (the year of the elephants), and
				in the same year the Prophet of Allah (pbuh) was born.

			<p>
				To understand this Surah it is necessary to know the
				historical background of the tribe of Qureysh. It was
				scattered throughout Hijaz until the time of Qusayy bin
				Kilab, the ancestor of the Prophet (pbuh). First of all,
				Qusayy gathered his tribe in Makkah and the tribe was
				able to gain authority over the Ka'bah. On that very
				basis, Qusayy was called Mujammi (uniter, assembler) by
				his people. This man, by his sagacity and wisdom, founded
				a city state in Makkah and made excellent arrangements
				for the welfare of the pilgrims coming from all over
				Arabia, with the result that the Qureysh were able to
				gain great influence among the Arabian tribes and lands.
				After Qusayy's death, the offices of the state of Makkah
				were divided between his sons, Abdi Manaf and Abd ad-Dar,
				but of the two Abdi Manaf gained greater fame even during
				his father's lifetime and was held in high esteem
				throughout Arabia. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Abdi Manaf had four sons; Hashim, Abdi Shams,
				Al-Muttalib, and Naufal. Of these, Hashim, father of
				Abdul Muttalib and grandfather of the Prophet, first
				conceived the idea to take part in the trade that passed
				between the eastern countries, Syria and Egypt through
				Arabia. He also purchased the necessities of life for the
				Arabians so that the tribes living by the trade route
				bought these from them and the merchants living in the
				interior of the country were attracted to the market of
				Makkah. This was the time when the Sasanian kingdom of
				Iran had gained control over the international trade that
				was carried out between the northern lands, the eastern
				countries and the Byzantine empire through the Persian
				Gulf. This boosted the trade activity on the trade route
				leading from southern Arabia to Syria and Egypt along the
				Red Sea coast. As with the other Arabian caravans, the
				Qureysh took advantage of the fact that the tribes on
				this route held them in high esteem because of their
				status of being Keepers of the Ka'bah. They stood
				indebted to them for the great generosity with which the
				Qureysh treated them in the Hajj season. That is why the
				Qureysh felt no fear that their caravans would be robbed
				or harmed any where along the way. The tribes along the
				way did not even charge them the heavy transit taxes that
				they demanded from the other caravans. Hashim, taking
				advantage of this, prepared the trade scheme and made his
				three brothers partners in it. Thus, Hashim obtained
				trade privileges from the Ghassanide king of Syria, Abdi
				Shams from the Negus, Al-Muttalib from the Yamanite
				nobles and Naufal from the governments of Iraq and lran,
				and their trade began to flourish. That is how the four
				brothers became famous as traders and began to be called
				Ashab Al-Ilaf (generators of love and affection) on
				account of their friendly relations with the tribes and
				states of the surrounding lands.
			</p>
			<p>
				Because of their business relations with Syria, Egypt,
				Iraq, Iran, Yaman and Abyssinia, the Qureysh became the
				most affluent tribe in Arabia and Makkah became the most
				important commercial center of the Arabian peninsula.
				Another great advantage that accrued from these
				international relations was that the caravans brought
				from Iraq tile script which later was used for writing
				down the Qur'an. No other Arabian tribe could boast of so
				many literate people as Qureysh. For these very reasons,
				the Prophet (pbuh) said: "The Qureysh are the leaders of
				men." (Musnad Ahmed: Marwiyat Amr bin al-As). 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Qureysh were thus prospering and flourishing when the
				event of Abrahah's invasion of Makkah took place. Had
				Abrahah succeeded in taking this Holy City and destroying
				the Ka'bah, the glory and renown of not only the Qureysh,
				but of the Ka'bah itself, would have suffered a great
				setback. The belief of pre-Islamic Arabia that the House
				indeed was Allah's House, would have been shattered, and
				the high esteem in which the Qureysh were held for being
				keepers of the House throughout the country would have
				been tarnished. Then, after the Abyssinian advance to
				Makkah, the Byzantium also would have taken the
				initiative to gain control over the trade route between
				Syria and Makkah. The Qureysh would have been reduced to
				a plight worse than that in which they were involved
				before Qusayy bin Kilab. But when Allah showed this
				manifestation of His power where swarms of birds
				destroyed 60,000 Abyssinian troops brought by Abrahah by
				pelting them with stones, from Makkah to Yaman they
				continued falling and dying by the wayside. The faith of
				the Arabs that the Ka'bah indeed was Allah's House,
				increased manifold, and the glory and renown of Qureysh
				was also enhanced considerably throughout the country.
				Now the Arabs were convinced that they were under Allah's
				special favor. They, therefore, visited every part of
				Arabia fearlessly and passed through every land with
				their trade caravans unharmed. No one would dare touch
				them with an evil intention. Not to speak of touching
				them, even if they had a non-Qureyshite under their
				protection, he too was allowed to pass unharmed. That is
				why in this Surah, the Qureysh are simply asked to
				consider; "When you yourselves acknowledge this House
				(i.e. The Ka'bah) to be Allah's House, and not of the
				idols, and when you fully know that it is Allah Alone Who
				has granted you peace by virtue of this House, made your
				trade and commerce flourish and favored you with
				prosperity, you should then worship none but Him Alone!"

				There is a difference of opinion relating to this Surah's

				But Abu Hayyan in Al-Bahr al-Muhit, has cited Ibn 'Abbas,
				Qatadah and Dahhak as saying that this Surah was revealed
				at Madinah. However, there is a piece of evidence in the
				Surah itself, which points to its being a Madani
				revelation. It holds out a threat of destruction to those
				who offer the Salah (prayers) but are unmindful of their
				Salah since they want only to be seen offering the
				prayers. These kind of hypocrites were only at Madinah.

				The theme of this Surah is to point out what kind of

				four verses, the state of those hypocrites who apparently
				are Muslims but do not believe in the Hereafter: the Day
				of Judgement, reward and the punishment, has been
				described. On the whole, the objective of depicting the

				The disbelieving Qureysh used to say: "Muhammad (pbuh) is
				cut off from his community and reduced to a powerless and
				helpless individual. Muhammad bin Ishaq says: "Whenever
				the Prophet (pbuh) was mentioned before As bin Wa'il ,
				the chief of Makkah, he used to say: Leave him alone for
				he is only a childless man (abtar) with no male
				offspring. When he dies, there will be no one to remember
				him." (Reported by Ibn Jarir). Ibn Sa'ad and lbn Asakir
				have related that Sayyiduna Abdullah bin 'Abbas said;
				"The eldest son of the Prophet (pbuh) was Qasim; next to
				him was Zainab, next to her Sayyiduna Abdullah and next
				to him three daughters; Umme Kulthum, Fatimah and
				Ruqayyah. Of them first Sayyiduna Qasim died and then
				Sayyiduna Abdullah. Thereupon As bin Wa'il said: "His
				line has come to an end; now he is abtar (i. e. cut off
				from the root)." Abu Jahl also had said similar words on
				the death of the Prophet's son, Abdullah.
			</p>
			<p>
				Such were the disturbing conditions under which Surah
				Al-Kauthar was sent down. The Qureysh were angry with him
				because he worshipped and served only Allah and
				repudiated their idolatry publicly. For this very reason,
				he was deprived of the rank, esteem and honor that he
				enjoyed among his people before Prophethood and was now
				cut off from his community. The handful of his Companions
				were helpless, poor people who were also being persecuted
				and tyrannized. The Prophet (pbuh) was grieved by the
				death of his two sons, one after the other, whereas the
				near relatives and the people of his clan were rejoicing
				and uttering such words which were disheartening and
				disturbing for a noble person who had treated even his
				enemies most kindly. At this, Allah in just one sentence
				of this brief Surah, gave him the good news - better news
				than which has never been given to any man in the world.

				religion, their rites of worship, and their gods; to
				express their total disgust and unconcern with them; to

				word which will protect you from polytheism? It is that
				you should recite Qul ya-ayyuhal Kafirun when you go to
				bed." (Reported by Abu Ya'la, Tabarani). Sayyiduna Anas

			<p>
				There was a time in Makkah when although a storm of
				opposition had arisen in the pagan society of Qureysh
				against the message of Islam preached by the Prophet
				(upon whom be peace), the Qureysh chiefs had not yet lost
				hope that they would reach some sort of a compromise with
				him. Therefore, from time to time they would visit him
				with different proposals of compromise so that he may
				accept compromise and the dispute between them may end.
				In this connection, different traditions have been
				related in the Hadith.
			</p>
			<p>
				According to Sayyiduna Abdullah bin 'Abbas, the Qureysh
				proposed to the Prophet: "We shall give you so much
				wealth that you will become the richest man of Makkah.
				Further, we shall give you whichever woman you like in
				marriage and are prepared to follow and obey you as our
				leader on the condition that you will not speak ill of
				our gods. If you do not agree to this, we present another
				proposal which is to your and our advantage." When the
				Prophet asked what it was, they said that if he would
				worship their gods, Lat and Uzza, for a year, they would
				worship his God for the same span of time. The Holy
				Prophet said: "Wait awhile let me see what my Rabb
				commands in this regard." Thereupon this revelation came
				down. According to another tradition from Ibn 'Abbas, the
				Qureysh said to the Prophet: "O Muhammad, if you kiss our
				gods (idols), we shall worship your God." Thereupon, this
				Surah was sent down. Yet in another tradition Said bin
				Mina (the freed slave of Abul Bakhtari) has related that
				Walid bin Mughirah, As bin Wail, Aswad bin Al-Muttalib
				and Umayyah bin Khalaf met the Prophet (pbuh) and said to
				him: "O Muhammad (pbuh), let us agree that we would
				worship your God and you would worship our gods, and we
				would make you a partner in all our works. If what you
				have brought was better than what we possess, we would be
				partners in it with You, and have our share in it, and if
				what we possess is better than what you have brought, you
				would be partner in it with us and have your share of
				it." At this Allah sent down: Qul ya-ayyuhal-Kafirun (Ibn
				Jarir, Ibn Abi Hatim, Ibn Hisham also has related this
				incident in the Seerah).
			</p>
			<p>
				Because of these repeated dialogue, there was a need that
				the Qureysh be given a definite, decisive reply so that
				their hope of Muhammad ( pbuh) coming to terms with them
				on the principle of "give and take" would be frustrated
				for ever.

				Allah has cursed Abu Lahab and his wife who were the
				opponents of the Holy Prophet
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="History">
			<p>
				This is the only place in the Qur'an where a person from
				among the enemies of Islam has been condemned by name,
				even though in Makkah, as well as in Madinah after the
				migration, there were many people who were in no way less
				inimical to Islam and the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) than
				Abu Lahab. The question is, what was the special trait of
				the character of this person, which became the basis of
				this condemnation by name? To understand this it is
				necessary that one understand the Arabian society of that
				time and the role that Abu Lahab played in it.
			</p>
			<p>
				In ancient days there prevailed chaos, confusion,
				bloodshed and plunder throughout Arabia. The condition
				for centuries was that a person could have no guarantee
				of the protection of life, honor and property except with
				the help and support of his clansmen and blood relations.
				Therefore, silah rehmi (good treatment of the kindred)
				was esteemed most highly among the moral values of the
				Arabian society and the breaking off of connections with
				kindred was regarded as a great sin. Under the influence
				of this same Arabian tradition, the Prophet (pbuh) began
				to preach the message of Islam. The other clans of
				Qureysh and their chiefs resisted and opposed him tooth
				and nail, but the Bani Hashim and the Bani Al-Muttalib
				(children of Al-Muttalib, brother of Hashim) not only did
				not oppose him but continued to support him openly, even
				though most of them had not yet believed in his
				Prophethood. The other clans of Qureysh regarded this
				support by the Prophet's blood relations as perfectly in
				accordance with the moral traditions of Arabia. That is
				why they never taunted the Bani Hashim and the Bani
				Al-Muttalib, even though they seemingly had abandoned
				their ancestral faith by supporting a person who was
				preaching a new faith. They knew and believed that they
				could in no case hand over an individual of their clan to
				his enemies, and their support and aid of a clansman was
				perfectly natural in the sight of the Qureysh and the
				people of Arabia.
			</p>
			<p>
				This moral principle, which the Arabs even in the
				pre-Islamic days of ignorance, regarded as worthy of
				respect and inviolable was broken only by one man in his
				enmity of Islam, and that was Abu Lahab, son of Abdul
				Muttalib, an uncle of the Prophet. In Arabia, an uncle
				represented the father especially when the nephew was
				fatherless. The uncle was expected to look after the
				nephew as one of his own children. But this man in his
				hostility to Islam and love of Kufr trampled over all of
				the Arab traditions with his actions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Before the proclamation of Prophethood, two of the
				Prophet's daughters were married to two of Abu Lahab's
				sons, Utbah and Utaibah. When the Prophet began to invite
				people to Islam, Abu Lahab said to both his sons: "I
				would forbid myself seeing and meeting you until you
				divorce the daughters of Muhammad (pbuh)." Both of them
				subsequently divorced their wives. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Whenever the Prophet went to preach the message of Islam,
				this man followed him and forbade the people to listen to
				him. Tariq bin Abdullah Al-Muharibi says: "I saw in the
				fare of Dhul-Majaz the Prophet (pbuh) exhorting the
				people saying: `O people, say La Ilah ill-Allah, you will
				attain success.' Behind him there was a man who was
				casting stones at him until his heels bled and he was
				telling the people: 'Do not listen to him, he is a liar.'
				I asked the people who he was. They said he was his
				uncle, Abu Lahab." (Reported by Tirmidhi).
			</p>
			<p>
				In the 7th year of Prophethood, when all of the clans of
				Qureysh socially and economically boycotted the Bani
				Hashim and the Bani Al- Muttalib, both of these clans who
				remained steadfast in the Prophet's support were besieged
				in Shi'b Abi Talib. Abu Lahab was the only person who
				sided with the disbelieving Qureysh against his own clan.
				This boycott continued for three years, so much so that
				the Bani Hashim and the Bani Al- Muttalib began to
				starve. This, however, did not move Abu Lahab. When a
				trade caravan came to Makkah and a besieged person from
				Shi'b Abi Talib approached it to buy some food, Abu Lahab
				shouted out to the merchants to demand a forbidding
				price, telling them that he would make up for any loss
				that they incurred. Thus, they would demand exorbitant
				rates and the poor customer would return empty handed to
				his starving children. Then Abu Lahab would purchase the
				same articles from them at the market rates. (Reported by
				Ibn S'ad, Ibn Hisham).
			</p>
			<p>
				On account of these misdeeds this man was condemned in
				this Surah by name. It was against the established
				traditions of Arabia that an uncle would oppose his
				nephew without a reason or pelt stones and bring false
				accusations against him publicly. Therefore, people were
				influenced by what Abu Lahab said and were in doubt about
				the Prophet (pbuh). But when this Surah was revealed, Abu
				Lahab filled with rage started uttering nonsense, the
				people realized that what he said in opposition to the
				Prophet was not at all reliable and was out of hostility
				to his nephew.
			</p>
			<p>
				When the Prophet's uncle was condemned by name, the
				people's expectations that the Messenger (pbuh) could
				treat some relative leniently in the matter of religion
				was frustrated forever. When the Prophet's own uncle was
				taken to task publicly. The people understood that there
				was no room for preference or partiality in their faith.
				A non-relative could become a near and dear one if he
				believed, and a near relation a non-relative if he
				disbelieved. Thus, there is no place for the ties of
				blood in religion.

				This Surah was revealed during the earliest period at
				Makkah when detailed verses of the Qur'an dealing with
				the essence and attributes of Allah Almighty had not yet
				been revealed, and the people, hearing the Prophet's
				invitation to Allah, wanted to know what his God, whose
				worship and service he was calling them to, was like.

				It is important to know what the religious concepts of
				the world were at the time the Prophet began to preach
				the message of Tawhid. The idolatrous polytheists were
				worshipping gods made of wood, stone, gold, silver and
				other substances. These gods had forms, shapes and bodies
				and the gods and goddesses were descended from each
				other. No goddess was without a husband and no god
				without a wife. They stood in need of food and drink and
				their devotees arranged these for them. A large number of
				the polytheists believed that God assumed human form and
				there were some people who descended from Him. Although
				the Christians claimed to believe in One God, they also
				believed that their God had at least a son, and that the
				Father, Son and the Ghost also had the honor of being
				associated with their Godhead to such an extent that God
				had a mother and a mother-in-law as well. The Jews also
				claimed to believe in One God, but their God too was not
				without physical, material or other human qualities and
				characteristics. He went for a stroll, appeared in human
				form, wrestled with a servant of His, and was father of a
				son, Ezra. In addition to these religious communities,
				the Zoroastrians - fire worshippers and the Sabians -
				star worshippers, also existed. Under such conditions
				when the people were invited to believe in Allah, the
				One, Who has no associate, it was inevitable that
				questions arose in their minds as to what kind of God He
				was, Who was the One and Only and Whose invitation to
				believe in Him was being given at the expense of all
				other gods and deities. It is a miracle of the Qur'an,
				that in a few brief words it answered all questions and
				presented such a clear concept of the Being of Allah that
				all polytheistic concepts were destroyed, leaving no room
				for the ascription of human qualities to His Being.
			</p>
			<p>
				That is why the Prophet (pbuh) held this Surah in such
				great esteem. This made the Muslims realize its
				importance in different ways and exhorted them to recite
				it frequently and disseminate it among the people. It
				states the foremost and fundamental doctrine of Islam
				(Tawhid) in four brief sentences, impresses on human
				memory and can be read and recited easily. There are a
				great number of Hadith which show that the Prophet, on
				different occasions and in different ways, told the
				people that this Surah is equivalent to one third of the
				Qur'an. Several ahadith on this subject have been related
				in Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Daud, Nasai, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah,
				Musnad Ahmed, Tabarani and other books. Commentators have
				also given many explanations of the Prophet's saying. In
				Abul A'la Maududi's opinion it simply means that the
				religion presented by the Qur'an is based on three
				doctrines: Tawhid, Risalat and the Hereafter. This Surah
				teaches Tawhid, pure and undefiled. Therefore, the
				Prophet (pbuh) regarded it as equal to one-third of the
				Qur'an.

				There is a difference of opinion relating to the place
				and period of these Surahs' revelation. According to
				Sayyiduna Hasan Basri, 'Ikrimah, 'Ata' and Jabir bin Zaid
				these Surahs are Makki. Ibn S'ad, Imam Baihaqi, 'Abd bin
				Humaid and others are of the opinion that these Surahs
				were revealed in A.H. 7, when the Jews had worked magic
				on the Prophet (upon whom be peace) in Madinah and he had
				fallen ill under its effect. The subject matter of these
				Surahs is explicit that they were sent down at Makkah
				when, for the first time, opposition to the Prophet had
				grown very intense. Later, when at Madinah storms of
				opposition were raised by the hypocrites, Jews and
				polytheists, the Prophet was instructed to recite these
				very Surahs, as has been mentioned in the above cited
				tradition from Sayyiduna Uqbah bin Amir. After this, when
				magic was worked on him and his illness grew intense,
				Gabriel came and instructed him by Allah's command to
				recite these very Surahs. Therefore, the view held by the
				commentators who describe both these Surahs as Makki is
				more reliable.

				As soon as the Prophet (pbuh) began to preach the message
				of Islam, it seemed as though he had provoked all classes
				of the people around him. As his message spread the
				opposition of the disbelieving Qureysh also became more
				and more intense. As long as they had any hope that they
				would be able to prevent him from preaching his message
				by throwing some temptation in his way, or striking some
				bargain with him, their hostility did not become very
				active. But when the Prophet completely disappointed them
				by the fact that he would not accept any kind of
				compromise with them in the matter of Faith, and in Surah
				Al-Kafirun they were plainly told: "I do not worship
				those who you worship nor are you worshippers of Him Whom
				I worship. For you is your religion and for me is mine",
				the hostility reached its extreme limits. More
				particularly, the families whose members (men, women,
				boys or girls) had accepted Islam, were burning with rage
				against the Prophet. They were cursing him, holding
				secret consultations to kill him quietly in the darkness
				of the night so that the Bani Hashim could not discover
				the murderer and take revenge; magic and charms were
				being worked on him so as to cause his death, make him
				fall ill, or become mad; shaitans from among the men and
				jinn spread every where to whisper one or another evil
				into the hearts of the people against him and the Qur'an
				he brought, to incite suspicion and cause him to flee.
				There were many people who were burning with jealousy,
				for they could not tolerate it that a man from a
				different family or clan should flourish and become
				prominent. For example, the reason why Abu Jahl was
				crossing every limit in his hostility to the Prophet was
				explained by him: "We and the Bani Abdi Manaf (to which
				the Prophet belonged) were rivals of each other: they fed
				the poor, we too fed the poor; they provided conveyances
				to the people, we too did the same; they gave donations,
				we too gave donations, so much so that when they and we
				have become equal in honor and nobility, they now
				proclaimed that they have a Prophet who is inspired from
				heaven; how can we compete with them in this field? By
				God, we will never acknowledge him, nor affirm faith in
				him." (Ibn Hisham, vol. I, pp. 337-338)
			</p>
			<p>
				Under these conditions, the Prophet (pbuh) was commanded
				to tell the people: "I seek refuge with the Lord of the
				dawn, from the evil of everything that He has created,
				and from the evil of the darkness of night and from the
				evil of magicians, men and women, and from the evil of
				the envious", and to tell them: "I seek refuge with the
				Rabb of mankind, the King of mankind, and the Deity of
				mankind, from the evil of the whisperer, who returns over
				and over again, who whispers (evil) into the hearts of
				men, whether he be from among the jinn or men." This is
				similar to what the Prophet Moses had been told to say
				when Pharaoh had expressed his desire to kill him before
				his full court: "I have taken refuge with my Rabb and
				your Rabb against every arrogant person who does not
				believe in the Day of Reckoning." (Surah Al-Mu'min: 27).
				And: "I have taken refuge with my Rabb and your Rabb lest
				you should assail me." (Surah Ad-Dukhan: 20).
			</p>
			<p>
				On both occasions, these illustrious Prophets of Allah
				were confronted with well-equipped, resourceful and
				powerful enemies. On both occasions, they stood firm on
				the message of Truth against their strong opponents, even
				though they had no material power on the strength of
				which they could fight them, and on both occasions they
				utterly disregarded the threats, dangerous plans and
				hostile devices of the enemy, saying: "We have taken
				refuge with the Rabb of the universe against you."
				Obviously, such firmness and steadfastness can be shown
				only by the person who has the conviction that the power
				of His Rabb is the supreme power, that all powers of the
				world are insignificant against Him, and that no one can
				harm the one who has taken His refuge. Only such a person
				can say: "I will not give up preaching the Word of Truth.
				I care the least for what you may say or do, for I have
				taken refuge with my Rabb and your Rabb and Rabb of the
				whole universe."
