# 0.10 problems
# Ferret::Search::Similarity, Ferret::Search::Similarity.default missing
# IndexReader#latest? segfaults when used on multiple indexes

# The Rails ActiveRecord Ferret Mixin.
#
# This mixin adds full text search capabilities to any Rails model.
#
# The current version emerged from on the original acts_as_ferret plugin done by
# Kasper Weibel and a modified version done by Thomas Lockney, which  both can be 
# found on the Ferret Wiki: http://ferret.davebalmain.com/trac/wiki/FerretOnRails.
#
# basic usage:
# include the following in your model class (specifiying the fields you want to get indexed):
# acts_as_ferret :fields => [ 'title', 'description' ]
#
# now you can use ModelClass.find_by_contents(query) to find instances of your model
# whose indexed fields match a given query. All query terms are required by default, but 
# explicit OR queries are possible. This differs from the ferret default, but imho is the more
# often needed/expected behaviour (more query terms result in less results).
