= Environment Check

Environment Check is a plugin that checks to ensure the application
environment +RAILS_ENV+ matches the database environment. In the event that the
application environment doesn't match the database environment (say by
accidentally running development against production) an exception is thrown
along the lines of:

  Incorrect database 'production'; expected 'development'

The plugin assumes you have a model class named +SystemSetting+ which supports
looking up values using standard enumeration-like indexing and that the record
containing the value for the database environment is named +environment+.

=== Dependencies

* System Settings (system_settings)--unless you choose to implement the functionality yourself.
