INSTRUCTIONS

  1) Install the Rails Application Visualizer plugin.
     (script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rav/trunk)
  2) Make sure you have Graphviz installed. You can get it from
     http://graphviz.org/Download.php or through your OS package system.
  3) Chuckle and execute "rake visualize"!

OPTIONS

  Usage: rake visualize [FILENAME=filename] [MODELS=no] [CONTROLLERS=no]

    FILENAME specifies where you want the diagram. Default is
    'doc/diagram.png' in RAILS_ROOT. RAV guesses the format to use
    from the filename, so be sure to give it a proper extension. You
    may use any extension that Graphviz supports, including PNG, SVG,
    GIF, JPG, PS and even (no joke) VRML. If you want to generate a
    raw dot file for further editing in Graphviz, just specify a .dot
    extension.

    By default the diagram includes both models and controllers, but
    you may disable either with MODELS=no and CONTROLLERS=no.

NOTES

  On Mac OS X, you can use the Cocoa version of Graphviz available
  from http://www.pixelglow.com/graphviz/download/ as long as you link
  the executable to a place on your path. (e.g. ln -s
  /Applications/Graphviz.app/Contents/MacOS/dot /usr/local/bin/dot)
  Using the Cocoa version is recommended as the DarwinPorts version
  does not use the right fonts.

  You need to be in your RAILS_ROOT when you execute "rake visualize".
